Gibberellin A7 is a C19-gibberellin that is a pentacyclic diterpenoid responsible for promoting growth and development in plants. Initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi, it differs from gibberellin A1 in lacking the OH at C-7 (gibbane numbering). It has a role as a plant metabolite, a bacterial metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a lactone, a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid and a C19-gibberellin.
