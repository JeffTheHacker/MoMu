Ethyl 2-chloro-3-{2-chloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-4-fluorophenyl}propanoate is an ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-chloro-3-{2-chloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-4-fluorophenyl}propanoic acid with ethanol. It has a role as a proherbicide.
