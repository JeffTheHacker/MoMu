Idrapril is a hydroxamic, non-amino acid derivative angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Idrapril competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. Idrapril also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
