Thiourea dioxide appears as a white or light-yellow odorless crystalline powder. Mp:126°C. Soluble in water (27 g / L at room temperature). Decomposes exothermically at temperatures above 126°C with the emission of noxious gases (sulfur oxides, ammonia, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrogen sulfide) and carbon dioxide. Extended exposure to temperatures above 50°C and moisture may cause visible decomposition. Irritating to skin and mucous membranes. Corrosive to eye tissue. Used in leather processing, the paper industry, photographic industry, and in textile processing as a bleaching agent.
