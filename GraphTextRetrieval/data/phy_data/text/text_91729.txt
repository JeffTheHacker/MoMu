Thifensulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfur atom is attached to a 2-carboxythiophen-3-yl group and in which the non-sulfonated nitrogen is substituted by a 4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. The corresponding methyl ester, known as thifensulfuron-methyl, is used as a post-emergence herbicide for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. It has a role as a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of 1,3,5-triazines and a thiophenecarboxylic acid.
