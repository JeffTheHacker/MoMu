Deferoxamine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of deferoxamine, an iron chelating agent.  Deferoxamine chelates iron from intra-lysosomal ferritin and hemosiderin forming ferrioxamine, a water-soluble chelate excreted by the kidneys and in the feces via the bile.  This agent does not readily bind iron from transferrin, hemoglobin, myoglobin or cytochrome. (NCI)
