AICA ribonucleotide is a 1-(phosphoribosyl)imidazolecarboxamide that is acadesine in which the hydroxy group at the 5' position has been converted to its monophosphate derivative. It has a role as a cardiovascular drug, a plant metabolite, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 1-(phosphoribosyl)imidazolecarboxamide and an aminoimidazole. It derives from an acadesine. It is a conjugate acid of a 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide(2-).
