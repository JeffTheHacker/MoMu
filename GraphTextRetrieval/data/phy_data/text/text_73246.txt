Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum semisynthetic, ampicillin-derived ureidopenicillin antibiotic. Piperacillin binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBP), the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a critical component of the bacterial cell wall. This blockade leads to the interruption of cell wall synthesis, consequently, leading to bacterial cell growth inhibition and cell lysis.
