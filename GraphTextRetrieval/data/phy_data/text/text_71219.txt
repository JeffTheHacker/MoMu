Pipequaline is an anticonflict & anticonvulsant quinoline derivative. It is an anxiolytic drug that was never marketed. It presents a unique chemical structure that does not follow the structural properties of other drugs of its class. Pipequaline has a similar pharmacological profile to the reported for the benzodiazepines. However, it presents a significant set of anxiolytic properties with a very little sedative, amnestic or anticonvulsant effect. Due to these differences, this drug is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic.
