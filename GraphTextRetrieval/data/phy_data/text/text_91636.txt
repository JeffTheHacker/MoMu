8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide that is 3',5'-cyclic AMP in which the hydrogen at position 2 on the purine fragment is replaced by a 4-chlorophenylthio group. It has a role as a protein kinase agonist. It is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide, an adenyl ribonucleotide, an organochlorine compound and an aryl sulfide. It derives from a 3',5'-cyclic AMP.
