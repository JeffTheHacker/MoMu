Amorolfine is a member of the class of morpholines that is cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a racemic 2-methyl-3-[p-(2-methylbutan-2-yl)phenyl]propyl group. An inhibitor of the action of squalene monooxygenase, Delta(14) reductase and D7-D8 isomerase and an antifungal agent, it is used (generally as its hydrochloride salt) for the topical treatment of fungal nail and skin infections. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.132 (squalene monooxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 5.3.3.5 (cholestenol Delta-isomerase) inhibitor and an EC 1.3.1.70 (Delta(14)-sterol reductase) inhibitor. It is a tertiary amino compound and a morpholine antifungal drug. It is a conjugate acid of an amorolfine(1+).
