Spiroxamine is the spiroketal resulting from the formal condensation of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone with 3-[ethyl(propyl)amino]propane-1,2-diol. An inhibitor of ergosterol synthesis, it is a broad spectrum agricultural fungicide used particularly against powdery mildew in the production of cereals, bananas and grapes. It has a role as a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a dioxolane, a tertiary amino compound and a spiroketal.
