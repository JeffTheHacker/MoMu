Taurultam is a reversible metabolite of taurolidine and an amino acid taurine derivative, with antibacterial and antineoplastic activity. Taurultam, like its congener taurolidine, inhibits proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells, although to a lesser extent, by selectively inhibiting the adhesion of endothelial cells to laminin but not to collagen I and fibronectin.
