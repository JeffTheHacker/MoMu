3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid is an organosilicon compound that is propionic acid substituted at position 3 by a trimethylsilyl group. It is used as internal reference in the NMR spectrum nuclear magnetic resonance for aqueous solvents (e.g. D2O). It is an organosilicon compound and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate.
