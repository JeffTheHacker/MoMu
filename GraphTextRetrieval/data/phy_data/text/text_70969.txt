Phentermine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine with central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and appetite depressant properties. Phentermine hydrochloride stimulates the release of norepinephrine and dopamine from nerve endings and blocks the reuptake of these monoamines at the neuronal junctions, resulting in CNS stimulation and metabolic effects, including appetite-suppression, decreased gastric acid secretion and increased blood pressure.
