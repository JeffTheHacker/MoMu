Amperozide is a diphenylbutylpiperazine atypical antipsychotic which antagonizes 5-HT2A receptors. It inhibits dopamine release and alters the firing of dopaminergic neurons. Investigations regarding the use of the agent revolved primarily around its capability for treating schizophrenia in humans even though the drug was ultimately never clinically adopted for this indication. Alternatively, amperozide's main use lies in veterinary medicine, where it is typically employed to minimize aggression and stress in intensively farmed pigs.
