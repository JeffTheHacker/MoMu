it is a pentacarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a pentetate(1-). it is an edetate and a chelating agent used in preparing radiopharmaceuticals. it (it) has strong affinity for iron but also shows affinities for other heavy metals, thereby is used in the treatment of iron-storage disease and poisoning from heavy and radioactive metals. it may chelate metallic moieties of unbound, extracellular radioimmunotherapeutics, thereby aggregating radioimmunotherapeutics locally to higher concentrations, and improving tumor cell radiocytotoxicity, while sparing normal tissues from the radiocytotoxic effects. In addition, it is used in radioimaing procedures when complexes with radioisotopes, ex., Tc 99m or In 111.
