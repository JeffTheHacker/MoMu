2, 3-Dimethyl-5-propylpyrazine, also known as N-pentylpyrazine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. 2, 3-Dimethyl-5-propylpyrazine is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3-dimethyl-5-propylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 3-dimethyl-5-propylpyrazine can be found in cereals and cereal products and crustaceans. This makes 2, 3-dimethyl-5-propylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
