it is a member of the class of pyridines that is (pyridin-2-yl)acrylic acid substituted at position 6 by a [(1E)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)prop-1-en-1-yl group. It is a non-sedating antihistamine used for treatment of hayfever, urticaria, and rhinitis. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, a member of pyridines, a N-alkylpyrrolidine and an olefinic compound. it is a synthetic alkylamine with non-sedative antihistaminergic activity. it competitively blocks the histamine H1 receptor and limits the typical allergic and anaphylactic responses, including bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and spasmodic contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle, caused by actions of histamine on bronchial, and gastrointestinal smooth muscles, and on capillaries. This drug also prevents histamine-induced pain and itching of the skin and mucous membranes. (NCI05)
