it, also known as nootkatane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eremophilane, 8, 9-secoeremophilane and furoeremophilane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based either on the eremophilane skeleton, its 8, 9-seco derivative, or the furoeremophilane skeleton. Eremophilanes have been shown to be derived from eudesmanes by migration of the methyl group at C-10 to C-5. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a citrus, gardenia, and grapefruit peel tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine), citrus, lime, and lemon. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
