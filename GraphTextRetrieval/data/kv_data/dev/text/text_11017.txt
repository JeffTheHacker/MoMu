Aspartic acid and derivatives are compounds containing an aspartic acid or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of aspartic acid at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as black cabbage, sour cherry, common walnut, and arctic blackberry. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
