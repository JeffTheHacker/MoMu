it is a triterpenoid saponin that is composed of soyasapogenol B having an alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid moiety attached at the 3-position via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a sialyltransferase inhibitor. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin, a trisaccharide derivative and a carbohydrate acid derivative. It derives from a soyasapogenol B. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-).
