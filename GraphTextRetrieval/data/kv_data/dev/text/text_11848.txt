, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as secondary alcohols. Secondary alcohols are compounds containing a secondary alcohol functional group, with the general structure HOC(R)(R') (R, R'=alkyl, aryl). Thus, is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule. is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). has been primarily detected in feces. Within the cell, is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, can be found in fruits and herbs and spices.
