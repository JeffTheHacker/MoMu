it appears as white prismatic needles (from acetone) or white powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a cyclic nonribosomal peptide of eleven amino acids; an immunosuppressant drug widely used in post-allogeneic organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system, and therefore the risk of organ rejection. Also causes reversible inhibition of immunocompetent lymphocytes in the G0- and G1-phase of the cell cycle. It has a role as an antifungal agent, an antirheumatic drug, a dermatologic drug, an immunosuppressive agent, a metabolite, a carcinogenic agent, an anti-asthmatic drug, an EC 3.1.3.16 (phosphoprotein phosphatase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. Cyclosporine is a natural cyclic polypeptide immunosuppressant isolated from the fungus Beauveria nivea. The exact mechanism of action of cyclosporine is not known but may involve binding to the cellular protein cytophilin, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme calcineurin. This agent appears to specifically and reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes in the G0-or G1-phase of the cell cycle. T-lymphocytes are preferentially inhibited with T-helper cells as the primary target. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and release. (NCI04)
