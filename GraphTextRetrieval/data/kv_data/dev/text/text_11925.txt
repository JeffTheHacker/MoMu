it is a homodetic cyclic peptide resulting from the formal condensation of both the amino and acid groups of L-histidine with the acid and amino groups of L-proline. It is a metabolite of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). It has a role as a human blood serum metabolite, a dopamine uptake inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide, a dipeptide, a pyrrolopyrazine and a member of imidazoles. It derives from a L-histidine and a L-proline.
