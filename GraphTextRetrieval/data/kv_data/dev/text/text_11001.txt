it is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of hexadecanoic acid with the thiol group of coenzyme A. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a palmitoyl bioconjugate, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA. It derives from a coenzyme A, a hexadecanoic acid and a hexadecanoate. It is a conjugate acid of a it(4-).
