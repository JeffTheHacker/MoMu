it is an odorless white solid. Sinks in water. (USCG, 1999) it is a beryllium molecular entity consisting of beryllium (+2 oxidation state) and oxide in the ratio 1:1. In the solid state, BeO adopts the hexagonal wurtzite structure form while in the vapour phase, it is present as discrete diatomic covalent molecules. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent. It is a beryllium molecular entity and a metal oxide. it is a white colored, crystalline, inorganic compound that emits toxic fumes of its upon heating. it is widely used in industry due to its low density and high thermal and electrical conductivity. It is used in high-technology ceramics, electronic heat sinks, electrical insulators, high-power devices, high-density electrical circuits, microwaves, X-ray windows, nuclear reactor fuels and for various aerospace and military applications. Inhalation exposure to its dust irritates the nose, throat and lungs and can cause pneumonitis. Prolonged exposure can result in a chronic beryllium disease called berylliosis causing granuloma and fibrosis formation in the lungs. Beryllium is associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. (NCI05)
