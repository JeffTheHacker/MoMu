it is an odorless white crystalline powder. Odorless. Bitter taste. (NTP, 1992) it is a dimethylxanthine having the two methyl groups located at positions 1 and 3. It is structurally similar to caffeine and is found in green and black tea. It has a role as a vasodilator agent, a bronchodilator agent, a muscle relaxant, an EC 3.1.4.* (phosphoric diester hydrolase) inhibitor, an anti-asthmatic drug, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulator, an adenosine receptor antagonist, a drug metabolite, a fungal metabolite and a human blood serum metabolite. it is a natural alkaloid derivative of xanthine isolated from the plants Camellia sinensis and Coffea arabica. it appears to inhibit phosphodiesterase and prostaglandin production, regulate calcium flux and intracellular calcium distribution, and antagonize adenosine. Physiologically, this agent relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, produces vasodilation (except in cerebral vessels), stimulates the CNS, stimulates cardiac muscle, induces diuresis, and increases gastric acid secretion; it may also suppress inflammation and improve contractility of the diaphragm.
