it is a parenterally administered, broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic typically used for moderate to severe gram negative infections. Despite its wide use, it has not been definitively linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. it is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by fermentation of Micromonospora purpurea or M. echinospora. it is an antibiotic complex consisting of four major (C1, C1a, C2, and C2a) and several minor components. This agent irreversibly binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Specifically, this antibiotic is lodged between 16S rRNA and S12 protein within the 30S subunit. This leads to interference with translational initiation complex, misreading of mRNA, thereby hampering protein synthesis and resulting in bactericidal effect. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.
