it, also known as dimethyl-heptane or 2-methyl octane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, isononane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, isononane can be found in alcoholic beverages, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes isononane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
