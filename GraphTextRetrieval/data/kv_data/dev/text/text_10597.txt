it, also known as 2-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase deficiency type I, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, the 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III pathway, and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid dehydrogenase deficiency.
