it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as angular pyranocoumarins. These are organic compounds containing a pyran (or a hydrogenated derivative) angularly fused to a coumarin moiety. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in citrus. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
