Encelin, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmanolides, secoeudesmanolides, and derivatives. These are terpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmanolide (a 3, 5a, 9-trimethyl-naphtho[1, 2-b]furan-2-one derivative) or secoeudesmanolide (a 3, 6-dimethyl-5-(pentan-2-yl)-1-benzofuran-2-one derivative) skeleton. Encelin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, encelin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, encelin can be found in herbs and spices. This makes encelin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
