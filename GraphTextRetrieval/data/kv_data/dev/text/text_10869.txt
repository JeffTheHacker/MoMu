it is the L-valinyl ester of ganciclovir, into which it is rapidly converted by intestinal and hepatic esterases. It is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine. It has a role as a prodrug and an antiviral drug. It is a member of purines and a L-valyl ester. It derives from a guanine and a ganciclovir. it is a synthetic prodrug of ganciclovir, a nucleoside analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, with antiviral activity. After phosphorylation, it is incorporated into DNA, resulting in inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, viral DNA synthesis, and viral replication. (NCI04)
