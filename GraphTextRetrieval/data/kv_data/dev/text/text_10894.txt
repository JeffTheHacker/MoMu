L-cis-Cyclo(aspartylphenylalanyl), also known as L-cis-cyclo(phenylalanylaspartyl) or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof. L-cis-Cyclo(aspartylphenylalanyl) exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, L-cis-cyclo(aspartylphenylalanyl) is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
