it is a semisynthetic first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic having methyl and beta-(2R)-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido groups at the 3- and 7- of the cephem skeleton, respectively. It is effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, and is used for treatment of infections of the skin, respiratory tract and urinary tract. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a cephalosporin, a semisynthetic derivative and a beta-lactam antibiotic allergen. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a beta-lactam, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. Compared to second and third generation cephalosporins, it is more active against gram-positive and less active against gram-negative organisms. it Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of it, a beta-lactam, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it hydrochloride binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs participate in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall, and in reshaping the cell wall during cell division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. it Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of it, a semisynthetic first-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
