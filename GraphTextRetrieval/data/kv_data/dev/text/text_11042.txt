it is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a 2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a but-2-enoyl-CoA and a 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(4-).
