Coreximine, also known as it or coramine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as protoberberine alkaloids and derivatives. These are alkaloids with a structure based on a protoberberine moiety, which consists of a 5, 6-dihydrodibenzene moiety fused to a quinolizinium and forming 5, 6-Dihydrodibenzo(a, g)quinolizinium skeleton. Coreximine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, coreximine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, coreximine can be found in soursop. This makes coreximine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
