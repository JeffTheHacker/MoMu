Alpha-Tocopherol acetate, also known as alpha tocopherol succinate or a-tocopherol acetic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as vitamin e compounds. These are a group of fat-soluble compounds containing or derived either from a tocopherol or a tocotrienol skeleton. Alpha-Tocopherol acetate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Alpha-tocopherol acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
