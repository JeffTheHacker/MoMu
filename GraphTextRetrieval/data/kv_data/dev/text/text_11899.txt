12:0 Cholesteryl ester, also known as it or cholest-5-en-3-yl laurate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cholesteryl esters. Cholesteryl esters are compounds containing an esterified cholestane moiety. Thus, 12:0 cholesteryl ester is considered to be a sterol lipid molecule. 12:0 Cholesteryl ester is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 12:0 Cholesteryl ester has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 12:0 cholesteryl ester is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 12:0 Cholesteryl ester exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
