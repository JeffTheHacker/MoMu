Tripamide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. Tripamide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, tripamide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
