it is an aminoquinoline, a nitrile, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It has a role as a protein kinase inhibitor. it is a 3-cyanoquinoline pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it irreversibly binds covalently to epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) ErbB-1, -2 and -4, thereby inhibiting receptor phosphorylation and signal transduction and resulting in apoptosis and suppression of proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress these receptors.
