it is an organic sodium salt. It contains a nafcillin(1-). it Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of the sodium salt of nafcillin, a narrow-spectrum beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin with antibacterial activity. Nafcillin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing cell lysis.
