it is a member of the class of benzoxaboroles that is 1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole substituted at position 5 by a fluoro group. A topical antifungal agent used for the treatment of onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toenails and fingernails). It has a role as an antifungal agent, a protein synthesis inhibitor and an EC 6.1.1.4 (leucine--tRNA ligase) inhibitor. It is an organofluorine compound and a benzoxaborole. it is a boron-containing small molecule antifungal agent with broad-spectrum activity against filamentous fungi, including both mold and yeast. 5-Fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole inhibits fungal cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase by preventing catalytic turnover, thus inhibiting synthesis of leucyl-tRNA(Leu) and consequentially blocking protein synthesis.
