Dipotassium clorazepate is the compound of monopotassium clorazepate with potassium hydroxide. It is used for the management of anxiety disorders, for the short-term relief of anxiety, as adjunctive therapy in the management of epilepsy, and for the symptomatic relief of acute alcohol withdrawal. It has a role as a prodrug, an anticonvulsant, an anxiolytic drug and a GABA modulator. It contains a clorazepate monopotassium. it is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties. it exerts its effect by de-activating the nervous system through potentiation of the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the GABA-A receptors by binding to a site that is distinct from the GABA binding site. Its inhibitory effect is caused by an increase in GABA-mediated chloride channel opening events, leading to hyperpolarization and synaptic inhibition.
