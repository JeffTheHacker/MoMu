it is a pyranonaphthoquinone antibiotic from strain OS-3966 of Streptomyces rosa var. notoensis. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a benzoisochromanequinone, an organooxygen heterocyclic antibiotic, a member of p-quinones and a monocarboxylic acid. it is a quinone antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces rosa var. notoensis with activity against gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and fungi. Within an organism, it is first reduced by flavin or NADH dehydrogenase then rapidly autooxidized leading to the production of singlet molecular oxygen (O2-). The increase in intracellular O2- results in inhibition of DNA, RNA and cell-wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Further, it may have antineoplastic properties resulting from a reduction in DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) and reactivating the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A.
