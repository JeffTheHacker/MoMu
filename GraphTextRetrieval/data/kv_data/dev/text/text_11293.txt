it is a recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist that has antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory actions and is used in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides. it is associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and with rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury. it is a recombinant human nonglycosylated interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to the IL-1 receptor, thereby blocking the binding of the IL-1 to and activation of its receptor. Blockade of IL-1 activity may inhibit the cascade of downstream pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6, resulting in inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.
