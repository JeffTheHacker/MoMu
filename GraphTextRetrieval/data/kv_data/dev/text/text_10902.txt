One or more of the three isomeric (1,2- 1,3- and 1,4-) dinitrobenzenes, which are solids at room conditions, presumably in a non-aqueous solvent or carrier. Toxic by skin absorption. Exposure of the confined material to heat or shock may result in explosive decomposition. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.
