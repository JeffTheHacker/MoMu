it is a purine nucleobase that consists of purine bearing an oxo substituent at position 6. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is an oxopurine, a purine nucleobase and a nucleobase analogue. It derives from an adenine. it is a purine-based organic compound in human muscle tissues, it is formed during purine catabolism as a product of xanthine oxidase action on xanthine, and occasionally is found as a constituent of nucleic acids. The potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of purines may be mediated by cell surface adenosine receptors. it protects against oxidant-induced cell injury by inhibiting activation of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).
