5-Ethynyl-5'-(1-propynyl)-2, 2'-bithiophene, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bi- and oligothiophenes. These are organic compounds containing two or more linked thiophene rings. Thiophene is a five-member aromatic ring with one sulfur and four carbon atoms. 5-Ethynyl-5'-(1-propynyl)-2, 2'-bithiophene exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 5-ethynyl-5'-(1-propynyl)-2, 2'-bithiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
