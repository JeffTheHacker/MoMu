it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carbazoles. Carbazoles are compounds containing a three ring system containing a pyrrole ring fused on either side to a benzene ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, pyrafoline D is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, pyrafoline D can be found in herbs and spices. This makes pyrafoline D a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
