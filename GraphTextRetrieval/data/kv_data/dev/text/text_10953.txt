Any synthetic therapeutic agent which is chemically identical to or similar to the endogenous human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF). Synthesized in the hypothalamus, hCRF stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In cerebral edema, hCRF acts by impeding the flow of fluid from blood vessels into brain tissue, thereby decreasing edema and stabilizing intracranial pressure. This agent possesses anti-edema properties independent of adrenal gland function. (NCI05)
