it appears as a clear colorless liquid with an irritating chloroform-like odor. Density 9.8 lb / gal. Flash point 87Â°F. Polymerizable. If polymerization takes place inside a closed container, the container is subject to violent rupture. Irritates the skin and respiratory system. Toxic by ingestion. A confirmed carcinogen. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make plastics and as a solvent. it is an epoxide that is 1,2-epoxypropene in which one of the methyl hydrogens is substituted by chlorine. It is an organochlorine compound and an epoxide. It derives from a 1,2-epoxypropane. it is a volatile and flammable, clear, colorless, liquid, chlorinated cyclic ether with an irritating, chloroform-like odor that emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition. it is used in the manufacture of epoxy resins, synthetic glycerin and elastomers. Exposure to it irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract, and can cause chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and renal lesions. This substance also affects the blood. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen and may be associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory cancer. (NCI05)
