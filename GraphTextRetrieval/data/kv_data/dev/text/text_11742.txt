4-Ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. 4-Ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 4-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4-Ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, 4-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole can be found in mushrooms and nuts. This makes 4-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
