it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in alcoholic beverages, coffee and coffee products, and tea. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
