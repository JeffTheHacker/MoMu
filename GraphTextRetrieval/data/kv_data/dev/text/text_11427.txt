it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as cereals and cereal products, nuts, coffee and coffee products, and mushrooms.
