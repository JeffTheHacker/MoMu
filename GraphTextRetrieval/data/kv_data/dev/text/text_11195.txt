it is a cyclodepsipeptide consisting of a cyclic tetramer of the depsipeptide D-Hiv-N-methyl-L-leucine (where D-Hiv = D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid). Found in the fungal species Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii, it has insecticidal properties and is used as a commercial biopesticide to control of insects of agricultural, veterinary and medical significance. For elucidation of the structure, see Suzuki et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1977 v25, 2167-2170. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an insecticide and a fungal metabolite.
