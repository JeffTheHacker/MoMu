it, also known as it or fema 3506, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is an apple, cheese, and earthy tasting compound that can be found in spearmint. This makes 2-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
