Tetrahydro-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinylfuran, also known as 2-ethenyltetrahydro-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethenyl)-furan or 2-methyl-2-vinyl-5-isopropenyltetrahydrofuran, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrahydrofurans. These are heterocyclic compounds containing a saturated, aliphatic, five-membered ring where a carbon is replaced by an oxygen. Tetrahydro-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinylfuran is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, tetrahydro-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinylfuran is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Tetrahydro-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinylfuran is a green, herbal, and minty tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, coffee and coffee products, fruits, and herbs and spices. This makes tetrahydro-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinylfuran a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
