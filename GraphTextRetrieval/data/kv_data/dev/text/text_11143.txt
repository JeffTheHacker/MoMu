Thioproline is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is proline in which the methylene group at position 4 is replaced by a sulfur atom. It has a role as a hepatoprotective agent, an antioxidant and an antidote. It is a sulfur-containing amino acid, a thiazolidinemonocarboxylic acid and a non-proteinogenic alpha-amino acid. It is a tautomer of a thioproline zwitterion. it is a cyclic sulfur amino acid derivative with potential antineoplastic and antioxidant activities. Acting on cellular membranes of malignant cells through an unknown mechanism, it may induce malignant cells to revert back to an untransformed state. This agent may also restore contact inhibition, a phenomenon characterized by the paracrine inhibition of mitosis following the formation of a critical cell mass, presumably the result of cell-to-cell signal transfer. it may also produce antioxidant effects secondary to its release of cysteine and restoration of glutathione concentrations.
