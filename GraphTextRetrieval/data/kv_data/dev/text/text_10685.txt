2, 3 Or 10-mercaptopinane, also known as it or pinanyl mercaptan, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. 2, 3 Or 10-mercaptopinane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 3 or 10-mercaptopinane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 2, 3 Or 10-mercaptopinane has a grapefruit and sulfurous taste.
