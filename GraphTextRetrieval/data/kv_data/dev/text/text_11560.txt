it is an it that consists of erythronolide A having 2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-ribo-hexopyranosyl and 3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-beta-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl residues attahced at positions 4 and 6 respectively. It is an it and a cyclic ketone. It derives from an erythronolide A. It is a conjugate base of an it A(1+). it is a broad-spectrum, macrolide antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it diffuses through the bacterial cell membrane and reversibly binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This prevents bacterial protein synthesis. it may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug at the site of infection and the susceptibility of the organism involved.
