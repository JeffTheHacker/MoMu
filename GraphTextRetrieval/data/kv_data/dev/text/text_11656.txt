it, also known as N-nitro-1, 2-ethanediamine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitramines. These are organyl derivatives of nitramide with the general formula RNHO2 (R = organyl group). it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in mushrooms. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
