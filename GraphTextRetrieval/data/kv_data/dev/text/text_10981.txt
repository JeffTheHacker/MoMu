it is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzoic acid with the primary amino group of piperidin-2-ylmethylamine. An antiarrhythmic agent used (in the form of its acetate salt) to prevent and treat tachyarrhythmia (abnormal fast rhythm of the heart). It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of piperidines, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ether. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a synthetic agent derived from trifluoroethoxy-benzamide exhibiting antiarrhythmic and local anesthetic activity. As a class Ic antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels, it depresses polarization phase 0 and decreases the induction velocity of the His-Purkinje system. It also decreases phase 4 slope and increases the depolarization threshold. (NCI04)
