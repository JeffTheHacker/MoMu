it is a pyrazinopyridoindole that is 2,3,6,7,12,12a-hexahydropyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1,4-dione substituted at position 2 by a methyl group and at position 6 by a 1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl group (the 6R,12aR-diastereomer). A phosphodiesterase V inhibitor inhibitor, currently marketed in pill form for treating erectile dysfunction under the name it; and under the name Adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has a role as an EC 3.1.4.35 (3',5'-cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase) inhibitor and a vasodilator agent. It is a pyrazinopyridoindole and a member of benzodioxoles. it is a carboline-based compound with vasodilatory activity. it selectively inhibits the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific type 5 phosphodiesterase- (PDE-5)-mediated degradation of cGMP, which is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum of the penis. Inhibition of cGMP degradation by it results in prolonged muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and blood engorgement of the corpus cavernosa, and, so, prolonged penile erection.
