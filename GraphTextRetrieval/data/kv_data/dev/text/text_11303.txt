it, also known as it or NSC 688263, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it can be biosynthesized from melatonin; which is mediated by the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1. In humans, acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine is involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway.
