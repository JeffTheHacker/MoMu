It is a histamine H2-receptor agonist used clinically to test gastric secretory function. It has a role as a histamine agonist, a diagnostic agent and a gastrointestinal drug. It is a member of pyrazoles and a primary amino compound. it is a histamine H2 receptor agonist with diagnostic application. it selectively targets and binds to the H2 receptor, thereby mimicking the effect of histamine on these receptors. This may lead to an increase in gastric secretions. it can be used in gastric function tests.
