8-(Methylthio)octanenitrile, also known as 1-cyano-8-(methylthio)heptane or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles. Nitriles are compounds having the structure RC#N; thus C-substituted derivatives of hydrocyanic acid, HC#N. 8-(Methylthio)octanenitrile is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 8-(methylthio)octanenitrile is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 8-(methylthio)octanenitrile can be found in green vegetables. This makes 8-(methylthio)octanenitrile a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
