it is a phenethylamine alkaloid that is 2-phenylethanamine substituted by a methyl group at the amino nitrogen and a methyl and a hydroxy group at position 2 and 1 respectively. It has a role as a nasal decongestant, a sympathomimetic agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a plant metabolite and a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of phenylethanolamines and a phenethylamine alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a (-)-itium. it is an alkaloid that is an hydroxylated form of phenethylamineand sympathomimetic amine, with potential bronchodilatory and anti-hypotensive activities. Following administration, it activates post-synaptic noradrenergic receptors. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vasculature induces vasoconstriction, and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs leads to bronchodilation.
