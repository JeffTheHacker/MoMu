it is procaine in which one of the hydrogens ortho- to the carboxylic acid group is substituted by chlorine. It is used as its monohydrochloride salt as a local anaesthetic, particularly for oral surgery. It has the advantage over lidocaine of constricting blood vessels, so reducing bleeding. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, a peripheral nervous system drug and a central nervous system depressant. It is a benzoate ester and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It derives from a 2-diethylaminoethanol and a 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid.
