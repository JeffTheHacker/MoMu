All-cis-5,8,11,14,17-it is an it having five cis-double bonds at positions 5, 8, 11, 14 and 17. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a micronutrient, an antineoplastic agent, an antidepressant, a Daphnia galeata metabolite, a mouse metabolite, an anticholesteremic drug and a fungal metabolite. It is an it and an omega-3 fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of an all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-itaenoate. it is the free fatty acid (FFA) form of it (EPA), a polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acid found in fish oil with a 20-carbon backbone and 5 double bonds, with potential supplementing, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, immunomodulating, anti-angiogenic and chemopreventive activities. Upon administration of it, the free form of EPA is incorporated in cell membrane phospholipids and replaces arachidonic acid. This inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into thromboxanes and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upon oral administration of it, the EPA-FFA prevents and suppresses colonic neoplasia and reduces polyp formation and growth through as of yet not fully elucidated mechanisms.
