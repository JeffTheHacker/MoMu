it is an adrenergic agonist with vasoconstrictive activity. it selectively binds to and activates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature. This causes smooth muscle contraction and leads to a decrease in venous pooling and increase in blood pressure. This agent may also stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.
