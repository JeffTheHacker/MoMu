it is a polyglutamatable folate antagonist analogue of methotrexate with antineoplastic activity. it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby increasing cellular levels of polyglutamates, inhibiting thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase, impairing synthesis of purine nucleotides and amino acids, and resulting in tumor cell death. it may overcome tumor resistance to methotrexate, which loses its activity after it is polyglutamated.
