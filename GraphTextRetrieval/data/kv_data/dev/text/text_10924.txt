it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Glioma, Melanoma, Ependymoma, Gliosarcoma, and Lung Cancer, among others. it is a methylated tryptophan with immune checkpoint inhibitory activity. it inhibits the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan, and may increase or maintain tryptophan levels important to T cell function. Tryptophan depletion is associated with immunosuppression involving T cell arrest and anergy.
