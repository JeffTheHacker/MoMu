it, also known as ent-kaurenal or kaur-16-en-18-al, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as kaurane diterpenoids. These are diterpene alkaloids with a structure that is based on the kaurane skeleton. Kaurane is a tetracyclic compound that arises by cyclisation of a pimarane precursor followed by rearrangement. It possesses a [3, 2, 1]-bicyclic ring system with C15-C16 bridge connected to C13, forming the five-membered ring D. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ent-16-kauren-19-al is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, ent-16-kauren-19-al can be found in fruits and sunflower. This makes ent-16-kauren-19-al a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
