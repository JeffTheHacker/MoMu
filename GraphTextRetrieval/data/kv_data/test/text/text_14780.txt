Hydroxymethyl indol-3-yl ketone, also known as 3-(hydroxyacetyl)indole or 2-hydroxy-1-(1H-indol-3-yl)-ethanone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indoles. Indoles are compounds containing an indole moiety, which consists of pyrrole ring fused to benzene to form 2, 3-benzopyrrole. Hydroxymethyl indol-3-yl ketone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, hydroxymethyl indol-3-yl ketone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, hydroxymethyl indol-3-yl ketone can be found in mushrooms. This makes hydroxymethyl indol-3-yl ketone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
