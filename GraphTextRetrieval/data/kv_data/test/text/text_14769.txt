it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02483247 (A Study of it in Combination With Selected Anti-Cancer Therapeutics in Adult Patients With Advanced Cancer). it is an orally available cancer cell stemness kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Even though the exact target has not been fully elucidated, amcasertib targets and inhibits one or more pathways involved in cancer stem cell survival. As a result, cancer stem cell (CSC) growth as well as heterogeneous cancer cell growth is inhibited. CSCs, self-replicating cells able to differentiate into heterogeneous cancer cells, appear to be responsible for both tumor relapse and metastasis.
