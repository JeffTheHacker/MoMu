Selenohomocysteine, also known as se-selenocysteine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). Selenohomocysteine is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Selenohomocysteine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Selenohomocysteine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, L-Serine and selenohomocysteine can be converted into selenocystathionine; which is mediated by the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase. Furthermore, Selenohomocysteine and adenosine can be biosynthesized from se-adenosylselenohomocysteine; which is mediated by the enzyme adenosylhomocysteinase. Furthermore, Selenohomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltri-L-glutamate can be converted into selenomethionine and tetrahydropteroyltri-L-glutamate; which is mediated by the enzyme N5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methyltransferase. Finally, Selenohomocysteine and pyruvic acid can be biosynthesized from selenocystathionine through the action of the enzyme cystathionine beta-lyase. In humans, selenohomocysteine is involved in the selenoamino acid metabolism pathway. Outside of the human body, selenohomocysteine can be found in a number of food items such as black raspberry, globe artichoke, oil-seed camellia, and longan. This makes selenohomocysteine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
