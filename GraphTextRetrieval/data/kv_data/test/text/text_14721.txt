Benzylpenicillin potassium is organic potassium salt of benzylpenicillin. It contains a benzylpenicillin(1-). it is the potassium salt form of penicillin G, a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic. it binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBP), the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall. This leads to the interruption of cell wall synthesis, consequently leading to bacterial cell growth inhibition and cell lysis.
