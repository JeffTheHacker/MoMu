Norcocaine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenol esters. These are aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring substituted by a hydroxyl group and an ester group. Norcocaine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, norcocaine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
