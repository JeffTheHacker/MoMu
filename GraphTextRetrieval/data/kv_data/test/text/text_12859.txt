Enoxolone is a pentacyclic triterpenoid aglycone metabolite of glycyrrhizin, which is a product of the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), with potential expectorant, and gastrokinetic activities. After administration, enoxolone inhibits the metabolism of prostaglandins by both 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] and prostaglandin reductase 2. Therefore, this agent potentiates the activity of prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha, which inhibits gastric secretion while stimulating pancreatic secretion and the secretion of intestinal and respiratory mucus, leading to increased intestinal motility and antitussive effects. Additionally, this agent inhibits 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes involved in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone in the kidneys.
