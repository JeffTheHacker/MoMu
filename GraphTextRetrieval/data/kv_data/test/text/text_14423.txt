it is a clear amber colored oily liquid with a faint odor of mustard/garlic. It is not readily combustible. Its vapors are heavier than air, are very toxic, and can be absorbed through the skin. The effects from exposure to the material include blindness which may be delayed. Prolonged exposure of the container to fire or intense heat may cause it to violently rupture and rocket. it is also known as dichlorodiethyl sulfide. Bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide is an ethyl sulfide that is diethyl sulfide in which a hydrogen from each of the terminal methyl groups is replaced by a chlorine. It is a powerful vesicant regulated under the Chemical Weapons Convention. It has a role as an alkylating agent, a vesicant and a carcinogenic agent. It is an organochlorine compound and an ethyl sulfide. it is a pale yellow, oily, highly toxic, volatile, liquid alkylating compound with a sweet to garlic-like odor that evaporates to a poisonous gas. it is a vesicant that was first used in chemical warfare in World War I, but is now only used in small amounts in research studies involving alkylating agents. Exposure to this substance is corrosive to the eyes, skin and lungs and leads to blindness and blistering of the skin and can cause severe and sometimes fatal respiratory damage. it is a mutagen and is a known carcinogen that is associated with an increased risk of developing lung and other respiratory tract cancers.
