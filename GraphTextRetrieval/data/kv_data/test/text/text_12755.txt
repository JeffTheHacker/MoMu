it is a member of naphthalenes, a ring assembly and a member of benzenes. it is a triphenylethylene nonsteroidal agent that acts as a partial estrogen antagonist. it competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to specific estrogen receptors. This agent also inhibits angiogenesis in some tissues by blocking the effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); paradoxically, it may enhance angiogenesis in uterine tissue. it also induces oxidative stress, protein kinase C and calcium signaling.
