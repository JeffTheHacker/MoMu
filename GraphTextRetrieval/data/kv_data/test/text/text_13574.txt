2, 2, 4-Trimethyldecane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. 2, 2, 4-Trimethyldecane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 2, 4-trimethyldecane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 2, 4-trimethyldecane can be found in alcoholic beverages and fats and oils. This makes 2, 2, 4-trimethyldecane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
