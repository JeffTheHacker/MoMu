it is the D-enantiomer of proline. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a D-alpha-amino acid and a proline. It is a conjugate base of a D-prolinium. It is a conjugate acid of a D-prolinate. It is an enantiomer of a L-proline. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. Proline is a cyclic, nonessential amino acid (actually, an imino acid) in humans (synthesized from glutamic acid and other amino acids), Proline is a constituent of many proteins. Found in high concentrations in collagen, proline constitutes almost a third of the residues. Collagen is the main supportive protein of skin, tendons, bones, and connective tissue and promotes their health and healing. (NCI04)
