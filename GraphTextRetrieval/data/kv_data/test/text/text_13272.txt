it is a synthetic galactosylfructose disaccharide used in the treatment of constipation and hepatic encephalopathy. It has a role as a laxative and a gastrointestinal drug. it is a disaccharide (sugar) synthesized from fructose and galactose, it is used to treat constipation and some liver diseases. Nondigestible in mammals, lactulose passes unabsorbed down to the large intestine where resident bacteria consume it and produce lactic, acetic, and formic acids, which draw fluid into the bowel to soften the stool (laxative effect). Acidification of the colon contents attracts ammonia from the bloodstream, assisting stool excretion; helpful in liver failure when ammonia cannot be detoxified. (NCI04)
