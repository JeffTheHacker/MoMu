Cafestol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthofurans. Naphthofurans are compounds containing a furan ring fused to a naphthalene moiety. Furan is a 5 membered- ring aromatic ring with four carbon and one oxygen atoms. Naphthalene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made up of two fused benzene rings. Cafestol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, cafestol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, cafestol can be found in arabica coffee, coffee, and coffee and coffee products. This makes cafestol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
