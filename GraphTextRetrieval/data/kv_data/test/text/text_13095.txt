Phytol is an acyclic diterpene alcohol and a constituent of chlorophyll. Phytol is commonly used as a precursor for the manufacture of synthetic forms of vitamin E and vitamin K1. Furthermore, phytol also was shown to modulate transcription in cells via transcription factors PPAR-alpha and retinoid X receptor (RXR).
