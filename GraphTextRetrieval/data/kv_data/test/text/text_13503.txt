it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, sherry lactone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, sherry lactone can be found in alcoholic beverages and root vegetables. This makes sherry lactone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
