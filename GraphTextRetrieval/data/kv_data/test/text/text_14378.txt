it is an N-nitrosourea that is urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a 2-chloroethyl group and by a nitroso group, while the other nitrogen is substituted by a cyclohexyl group. An alkylating antineoplastic agent, it is used in the treatment of brain tumours, lung cancer, malignant melanoma and other solid tumours. It has a role as an alkylating agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of N-nitrosoureas and an organochlorine compound. it is a nitrosourea with antineoplastic activity. it alkylates and crosslinks DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent also carbamoylates DNA and proteins, resulting in inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and disruption of RNA processing. it is lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier. (NCI04)
