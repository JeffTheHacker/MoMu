2-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanyl acetate, also known as benzyl dimethyl carbinyl acetate or 1, 1-dimethyl-2-phenylethyl acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety. 2-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanyl acetate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanyl acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanyl acetate has a sweet, berry, and floral taste.
