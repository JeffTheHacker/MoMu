Bisantrene is a hydrazone resulting from the formal condensation of both of the aldehyde groups of anthracene-9,10-dicarbaldehyde with 2-hydrazinyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a hydrazone, a member of imidazolidines and a member of anthracenes. Bisantrene is an anthracenyl bishydrazone with antineoplastic activity. Bisantrene intercalates with and disrupts the configuration of DNA, resulting in DNA single-strand breaks, DNA-protein crosslinking, and inhibition of DNA replication. This agent is similar to doxorubicin in activity, but unlike doxorubicin, does not exhibit cardiotoxicity. (NCI04)
