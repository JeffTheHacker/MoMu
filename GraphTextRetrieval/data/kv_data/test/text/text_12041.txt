6-Hydroxymusizin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenolic glycosides. These are organic compounds containing a phenolic structure attached to a glycosyl moiety. Some examples of phenolic structures include lignans, and flavonoids. Among the sugar units found in natural glycosides are D-glucose, L-Fructose, and L rhamnose. 6-Hydroxymusizin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 6-hydroxymusizin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 6-hydroxymusizin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside can be found in green vegetables. This makes 6-hydroxymusizin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
