5-N-Nonadecylresorcinol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as resorcinols. Resorcinols are compounds containing a resorcinol moiety, which is a benzene ring bearing two hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 3. 5-N-Nonadecylresorcinol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. 5-N-Nonadecylresorcinol has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, 5-N-nonadecylresorcinol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 5-N-nonadecylresorcinol can be found in a number of food items such as barley, pasta, corn, and rice. This makes 5-N-nonadecylresorcinol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
