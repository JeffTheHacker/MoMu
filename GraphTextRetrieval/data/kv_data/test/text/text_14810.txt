Ferric pyrophosphate citrate is a soluble iron replacement product. Free iron presents several side effects as it can catalyze free radical formation and lipid peroxidation as well as the presence of interactions of iron in plasma. The ferric ion is strongly complexed by pyrophosphate and citrate. FPC is categorized in Japan as a second class OTC drug. This category is given to drugs with ingredients that in rare cases may cause health problems requiring hospitalization or worst. It is also FDA approved since 2015.
