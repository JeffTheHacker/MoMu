it is a 3beta-sterol that is androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol substituted at position 17 by a 3-pyridyl group. Administered as the O-acetate, it is used for treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 1.14.99.9 (steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase) inhibitor. It is a 3beta-sterol and a member of pyridines. It derives from a hydride of an androstane. it is a steroidal compound with antiandrogen activity. it inhibits the enzymatic activity of steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase (17alpha-hydrolase/C17,20 lyase complex; CYP17A1), a member of the cytochrome p450 family that catalyzes the 17alpha-hydroxylation of steroid intermediates involved in testosterone synthesis. Administration of this agent may suppress testosterone production by both the testes and the adrenals to castrate-range levels.
