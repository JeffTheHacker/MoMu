(4alpha, 5beta, 6alpha, 7alpha, 10alpha)-it, also known as (4Î±, 5Î², 6Î±, 7Î±, 10Î±)-1-aromadendrene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as polycyclic hydrocarbons. These are polycyclic organic compounds made up only of carbon and hydrogen atoms (4alpha, 5beta, 6alpha, 7alpha, 10alpha)-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (4alpha, 5beta, 6alpha, 7alpha, 10alpha)-1-aromadendrene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
