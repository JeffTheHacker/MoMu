it, also known as fema 3395, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. Thus, it is considered to be an isoprenoid lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a sweet, camphor, and cinnamon tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as herbs and spices, cardamom, coriander, and sunflower. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
