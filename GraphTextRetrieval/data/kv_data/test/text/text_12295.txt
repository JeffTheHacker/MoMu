it is a member of the class of pyrazines that is pyrazine-2-carboxamide which is substituted by {3-methoxy-4-[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]phenyl}nitrilo, (oxan-4-yl)nitrilo and ethyl groups at positions 3,5 and 6, respectively. It is a potent inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL tyrosine kinase receptors (IC50 = 0.29 nM and 0.73 nM, respectively). Approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in patients who have a FLT3 gene mutation. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a N-methylpiperazine, a member of piperidines, a secondary amino compound, a monomethoxybenzene, a member of pyrazines, a primary carboxamide, an aromatic amine and a member of oxanes. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, STK1, or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246), with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated forms of FLT3, AXL and ALK. This may result in an inhibition of FLT3, AXL, and ALK-mediated signal transduction pathways and reduces tumor cell proliferation in cancer cell types that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL and ALK, overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play a key role in tumor cell growth and survival.
