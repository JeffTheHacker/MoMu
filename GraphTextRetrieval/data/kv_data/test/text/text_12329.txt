Phosphoribosyl-AMP, also known as 5-phosphoribosyl-amp, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purine ribonucleoside monophosphates. These are nucleotides consisting of a purine base linked to a ribose to which one monophosphate group is attached. Phosphoribosyl-AMP is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Phosphoribosyl-AMP exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Phosphoribosyl-AMP participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Phosphoribosyl-AMP can be converted into phosphoribosylformiminoaicar-phosphate through the action of the enzyme histidine biosynthesis trifunctional protein. In addition, Phosphoribosyl-AMP can be biosynthesized from 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP; which is catalyzed by the enzyme histidine biosynthesis trifunctional protein.
