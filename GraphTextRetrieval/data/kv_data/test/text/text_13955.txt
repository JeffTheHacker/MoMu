it appears as white orthorhombic sphenoidal crystals from water. pH of 0.05 molar solution: 5.85. (NTP, 1992) it is a hydrate that is the trihydrate form of scopolamine hydrobromide. It has a role as a mydriatic agent, a muscarinic antagonist, an anaesthesia adjuvant, an antispasmodic drug and an antiemetic. It contains a scopolamine hydrobromide (anhydrous). Scopolamine Hydrobromide is the hydrobromide salt form of scopolamine, a tropane alkaloid derived from plants of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), specifically Hyoscyamus niger and Atropa belladonna, with anticholinergic, antiemetic and antivertigo properties. Structurally similar to acetylcholine, scopolamine antagonizes acetylcholine activity mediated by muscarinic receptors located on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. The agent is used to cause mydriasis, cycloplegia, to control the secretion of saliva and gastric acid, to slow gut motility, and prevent vomiting.
