Dehydro-1, 8-cineole, also known as 1, 8-it or 1, 8-cineole dehydro, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrans. Pyrans are compounds containing a pyran ring, which is a six-member heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring with five carbon atoms, one oxygen atom and two ring double bonds. Dehydro-1, 8-cineole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, dehydro-1, 8-cineole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Dehydro-1, 8-cineole is a lemon and mint tasting compound that can be found in herbs and spices, sweet bay, and tea. This makes dehydro-1, 8-cineole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
