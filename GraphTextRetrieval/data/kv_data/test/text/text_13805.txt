it, also known as catechin gallate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as catechin gallates. These are organic compounds containing a gallate moiety glycosidically linked to a catechin. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-galloylcatechin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3-galloylcatechin can be found in a number of food items such as peanut, common hazelnut, pine nut, and almond. This makes 3-galloylcatechin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
