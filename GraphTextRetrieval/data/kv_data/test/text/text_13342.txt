it is the benzathine salt form of a semisynthetic beta-lactamase resistant penicillin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. Cloxacillin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, thereby preventing the cross-linkage of peptidoglycans, which are critical components of the bacterial cell wall. This leads to a weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing bacterial cell lysis.
