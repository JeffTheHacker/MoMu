it is a member of the class of pyridopyrimidines that is 2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one carrying an additional 2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]ethyl group at position 2. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, a H1-receptor antagonist, a second generation antipsychotic, a dopaminergic antagonist, a psychotropic drug and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is a pyridopyrimidine, an organofluorine compound, a heteroarylpiperidine and a member of 1,2-benzoxazoles. it is a benzisoxazole derivative with antipsychotic property. it selectively antagonizes serotonin (5-HT) effects via cortical 5-HT2 receptor, and, to a lesser extent, competes with dopamine at the limbic dopamine D2 receptor. The antagonism leads to decreased psychotic effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. In addition, it has low to moderate affinity for histamine H1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, and 5-HT1D receptors, while it has weak affinity for dopamine D1 and haloperidol-sensitive sigma site receptors.
