, also known as 5-oh-hxmf, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 8-o-methylated flavonoids. These are flavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C8 atom of the flavonoid backbone. Thus, is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, can be found in citrus and sweet orange. This makes a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
