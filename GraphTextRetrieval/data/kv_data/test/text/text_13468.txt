it is a steroid ester and a terminal acetylenic compound. It has a role as an estrogen receptor modulator, a contraceptive drug and a synthetic oral contraceptive. It derives from an ethynodiol. it is the diacetate salt form of ethynodiol, a semi-synthetic progestational hormone agonist. it binds to cytoplasmic progesterone receptors in the reproductive system and subsequently activates progesterone receptor mediated gene expression. As a result of the negative feedback mechanism, luteinizing hormone (LH) release is inhibited, which leads to an inhibition of ovulation and an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium. In addition, it has weak oestrogenic and androgenic properties.
