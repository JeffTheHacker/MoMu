2, 2-Dimethyloxirane, also known as 1, 2-it or 1, 2-epoxy-isobutane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as epoxides. Epoxides are compounds containing a cyclic ether with three ring atoms(one oxygen and two carbon atoms). 2, 2-Dimethyloxirane is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 2-dimethyloxirane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 2-dimethyloxirane can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 2-dimethyloxirane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
