Arginyl-leucine, also known as it or arg-leu, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. Arginyl-leucine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Arginyl-leucine has been primarily detected in feces.
