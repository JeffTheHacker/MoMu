it is an aromatic ketone that is propiophenone in which one of the hydrogens alpha- to the carbonyl is substituted by a diethylamino group. A central stimulant and indirect-acting sympathomimetic, it is an appetite depressant and is used as the hydrochloride as an anoretic in the short term management of obesity. It has a role as an appetite depressant. It is a tertiary amine and an aromatic ketone. It derives from a propiophenone. it is an amphetamine derivative and a sympathomimetic stimulant with anti-obesity and appetite-suppressant properties. it stimulates neurons to release and maintain high levels of catecholamines including dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in a suppression of hunger signals and appetite. This agent may also indirectly affect leptin-neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurotransmission, which exerts control on metabolic processes such as food intake and body weight homeostasis. Via elevated catecholamine, it indirectly elevates leptin levels in the brain, which in turn inhibits production of NPY, a potent stimulator of feeding behavior, thereby preventing the initiation of eating, increasing energy expenditure, and decreasing fat storage.
