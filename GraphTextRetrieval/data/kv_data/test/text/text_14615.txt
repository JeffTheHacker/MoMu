it is a hydrate. It contains a cetylpyridinium chloride. Cetylpyridinium Chloride is the chloride salt form of cetylpyridinium, a quaternary ammonium with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Upon topical administration, cetylpyridinium chloride is positively charged and reacts with the negatively charged microbial cell surfaces, thereby destroying the integrity of the cell membrane. This causes leakage of intracellular components leading to microbial cell death.
