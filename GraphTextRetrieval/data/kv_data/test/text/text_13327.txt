it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside that is 2'-deoxycytidine having a cyano group in the 2'-position. It is the active metabolite of the anti-cancer drug, sapacitabine which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a drug metabolite and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside and a nitrile. Deoxycytidine Analogue it is an analogue of the nucleoside deoxycytidine with potential antineoplastic activity. Nucleoside analogue it is incorporated into DNA and directly inhibits the activity of DNA polymerase, which may result in inhibition of DNA replication and cell cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases, DNA fragmentation, and tumor cell apoptosis.
