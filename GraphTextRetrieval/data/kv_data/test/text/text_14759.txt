it is a cyclic hydroxamic acid that is 1-hydroxypyridin-2(1H)-one in which the hydrogens at positions 4 and 6 are substituted by methyl and cyclohexyl groups, repectively. A broad spectrum antigfungal agent, it also exhibits antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has anti-inflammatory properties. It is used a a topical treatment of fungal skin and nail infections. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and an antiseborrheic. It is a pyridone, a cyclic hydroxamic acid and a hydroxypyridone antifungal drug. it is a synthetic, broad-spectrum antifungal agent with additional antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. it exerts its action by binding to and chelating trivalent cations, such as Fe3+ and Al3+, thereby inhibiting the availability of essential co-factors for enzymes. This may lead to a loss of activity of enzymes that are essential for cellular metabolism, organization of cell wall structure and other crucial cell functions. In addition, it exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase (COX).
