Chlorozotocin is a glucose-linked chloroethylnitrosourea with potential antineoplastic activity. Chlorozotocin alkylates DNA and proteins, induces the formation of interstrand DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks, and causes DNA strand breakage, thereby damaging DNA and resulting in cell death. This agent has been shown to exhibit antitumor and immunomodulatory effects in cell lines and animal models. Chlorozotocin is a mutagen and is less myelotoxic than other nitrosoureas. (NCI04)
