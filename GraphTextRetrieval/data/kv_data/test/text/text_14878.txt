it is a monosaccharide derivative, an anthracycline antibiotic and a deoxy hexoside. It derives from a hydride of a tetracene. it is a semisynthetic 4-demethoxy analogue of the antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin. it intercalates into DNA and interferes with the activity of topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein synthesis. Due to its high lipophilicity, it penetrates cell membranes more efficiently than other anthracycline antibiotic compounds.
