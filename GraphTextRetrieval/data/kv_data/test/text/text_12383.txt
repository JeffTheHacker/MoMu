it is the carbamic acid ester of 2-methylcholine. A slowly hydrolysed muscarinic agonist with no nicotinic effects, it is used as its chloride salt to increase smooth muscle tone, as in the gastrointestinal tract following abdominal surgery, treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and as an alternative to catheterisation in the treatment of non-obstructive urinary retention. It has a role as a muscarinic agonist. It is a quaternary ammonium ion and a carbamate ester.
