it is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-4-(difluoromethoxy)benzoic acid with the amino group of 3,5-dichloropyridin-4-amine. Used for treatment of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a role as a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor and an anti-asthmatic drug. It is a member of benzamides, a chloropyridine, an aromatic ether, an organofluorine compound and a member of cyclopropanes. it is an orally available, long-acting inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4 (PDE4), with anti-inflammatory and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, it and its active metabolite it N-oxide selectively and competitively bind to and inhibit PDE4, which leads to an increase of both intracellular levels of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-mediated signaling. cAMP prevents phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and abrogates activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which may result in the induction of apoptosis. PDE4, a member of the PDE superfamily that hydrolyses cAMP and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to their inactive 5' monophosphates, is upregulated in a variety of cancers and may contribute to chemoresistance; it also plays a key role in inflammation, especially in inflammatory airway diseases.
