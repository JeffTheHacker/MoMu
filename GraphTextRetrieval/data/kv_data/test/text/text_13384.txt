it is a yellow oily liquid with a faint characteristic odor. Boiling point 151-153Â°C. Can reasonably be expected to be a carcinogen. Used as an antioxidant, as an additive for lubricants and as a softener of copolymers. An intermediate in 1,1-dimethylhydrazine production. it is a nitrosamine. It has a role as a mutagen. it is a volatile, combustible, yellow, oily liquid nitrosamine with a faint characteristic odor that decomposes when exposed to light and emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition. it is primarily used in laboratory research to induce tumors in experimental animals. This substance may be formed during the cooking of foods, especially cured meats and fish, that contain sodium nitrite as a preservative, but is also found in several vegetables, cheeses, alcoholic beverages and fruits, and as a contaminant in rubber products. Exposure to NNitrosodimethylamine irritates the skin and eyes and damages the liver. This substance is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
