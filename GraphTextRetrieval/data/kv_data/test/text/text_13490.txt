it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl carnitines. These are organic compounds containing a fatty acid with the carboxylic acid attached to carnitine through an ester bond. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
