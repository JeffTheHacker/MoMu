Dabigatran etexilate, also known as pradaxa or etexilate, dabigatran, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzimidazoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring (five member ring containing a nitrogen atom, 4 carbon atoms, and two double bonds). Dabigatran etexilate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Dabigatran etexilate has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, dabigatran etexilate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Dabigatran etexilate can be converted into dabigatran.
