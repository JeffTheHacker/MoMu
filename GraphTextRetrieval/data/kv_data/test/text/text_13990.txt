it is a 1,2-benzoxazole compound having a sulfamoylmethyl substituent at the 3-position. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, an antioxidant, a central nervous system drug and a protective agent. It is a member of 1,2-benzoxazoles and a sulfonamide. it is a sulfonamide derivative with an anticonvulsant property. The exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. it appears to block sodium and calcium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hyper-synchronization. Although it shows affinity for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex, it does not potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. In addition, this agent also facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission.
