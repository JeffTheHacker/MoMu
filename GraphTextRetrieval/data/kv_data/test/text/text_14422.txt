it (T131), an orally-administered therapy, is expected to lower blood glucose in type II diabetic patients by improving the bodyâs ability to respond to insulin. T131 is a selective modulator of PPARg (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma), a receptor involved in regulating the bodyâs ability to respond to insulin. T131 is not structurally related to the thiazolidinedione class of PPARg agonists, which includes Actos and Avandia.
