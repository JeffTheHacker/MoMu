it is an aminoquinoline that is chloroquine in which one of the N-ethyl groups is hydroxylated at position 2. An antimalarial with properties similar to chloroquine that acts against erythrocytic forms of malarial parasites, it is mainly used as the sulfate salt for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and light-sensitive skin eruptions. It has a role as an antimalarial, an antirheumatic drug, a dermatologic drug and an anticoronaviral agent. It is an aminoquinoline, an organochlorine compound, a primary alcohol, a secondary amino compound and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a chloroquine. It is a conjugate base of a it(2+). it is a 4-aminoquinoline with immunosuppressive, antiautophagy, and antimalarial activities. Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, it may suppress immune function by interfering with the processing and presentation of antigens and the production of cytokines. As a lysosomotropic agent, it raises intralysosomal pH, impairing autophagic protein degradation; it-mediated accumulation of ineffective autophagosomes may result in cell death in tumor cells reliant on autophagy for survival. In addition, this agent is highly active against the erythrocytic forms of P. vivax and malariae and most strains of P. falciparum but not the gametocytes of P. falciparum.
