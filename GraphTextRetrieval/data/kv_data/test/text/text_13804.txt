it is a 1,3-thiazolemonocarboxylic acid that is 4-methyl-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid which is substituted by a 3-cyano-4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl group at position 2. It is an orally-active, potent, and selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in patients with gout. It has a role as an EC 1.17.3.2 (xanthine oxidase) inhibitor. It is an aromatic ether, a nitrile and a 1,3-thiazolemonocarboxylic acid. it is an orally available, non-purine inhibitor of xanthine oxidase with uric acid lowering activity. Upon oral administration, it selectively and noncompetitively inhibits the activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that converts oxypurines, including hypoxanthine and xanthine, into uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, uric acid production is reduced and serum uric acid levels are lowered. it may provide protection against acute renal failure caused by the excessive release of uric acid that occurs upon massive tumor cell lysis resulting from the treatment of some malignancies.
