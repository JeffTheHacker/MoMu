1-Methyl-2-pyrrolecarboxaldehyde, also known as 1-methyl-2-formylpyrrole or 2-formyl-1-methylpyrrole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl-aldehydes. Aryl-aldehydes are compounds containing an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring. 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolecarboxaldehyde is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolecarboxaldehyde is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
