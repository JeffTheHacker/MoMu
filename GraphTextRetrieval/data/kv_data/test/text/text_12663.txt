it is a member of the class of indolones that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one which is substituted by a (2,6-dichlorobenzyl)sulfonyl group at position 5 and by a (1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methylidene group at position 2, the pyrrole ring of which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 3 and 5, and by a [2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]carbonyl group at position 4 (the Z,R isomer). It has a role as a c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of indolones, a pyrrolecarboxamide, a N-acylpyrrolidine, a sulfone, a dichlorobenzene, an enamide, a secondary carboxamide and a tertiary carboxamide.
