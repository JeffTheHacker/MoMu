Bis(2, 5-dimethyl-3-furanyl) disulfide, also known as 3, 3'-dithiobis(2, 5-dimethyl-furan or fema 3476, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. Bis(2, 5-dimethyl-3-furanyl) disulfide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, bis(2, 5-dimethyl-3-furanyl) disulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Bis(2, 5-dimethyl-3-furanyl) disulfide has a meaty taste.
