it is a carboxylic ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (6E)-8-methylnon-6-enoic acid with the benzylic hydroxy group of vanillyl alcohol. A non-pungent analogue of capsaicin with a similar biological profile. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a hypoglycemic agent, an anti-allergic agent, an antioxidant, an angiogenesis inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent and a capsaicin receptor agonist. It is a carboxylic ester, a monomethoxybenzene and a member of phenols. It derives from a vanillyl alcohol.
