it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl amines. N-acyl amines are compounds containing a fatty acid moiety linked to an amine group through an ester linkage. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty amide lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
