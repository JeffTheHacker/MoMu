it is a benzothiazine that is piroxicam in which the pyridin-2-yl group is replaced by a 5-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl group. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and selective inhibitor of COX-2, it is used particularly for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an antirheumatic drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and an analgesic. It is a benzothiazine, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a member of 1,3-thiazoles. it is an oxicam derivative and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. Unlike traditional nonselective NSAIDs, it preferentially inhibits the activity of cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-II), resulting in a decreased conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin precursors. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis is responsible for the therapeutic effects of it.
