Norsertraline, also known as dasotraline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetralins. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a tetralin moiety, which consists of a benzene fused to a cyclohexane. Norsertraline is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Norsertraline has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, norsertraline is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
