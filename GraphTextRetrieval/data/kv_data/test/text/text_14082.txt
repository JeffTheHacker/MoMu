it is a member of the class of benzamides obtained by formal condensation of the 1- and 6-amino groups of hexane-1,2,6-triamine with the carboxy groups from two molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid followed by reduction of the amide carbonyl at position 5 to a hydroxy group. It has a role as a siderophore and a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of catechols and a member of benzamides. It derives from a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.
