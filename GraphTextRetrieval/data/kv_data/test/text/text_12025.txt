it is 3-Isopropylimino-3,5-dihydro-phenazine in which the hydrogen at position 5 is substituted substituted by a 4-chlorophenyl group, and that at position 2 is substituted by a (4-chlorophenyl)amino group. A dark red crystalline solid, it is an antimycobacterial and is one of the main drugs used for the treatment of multi-bacillary leprosy. However, it can cause red/brown discolouration of the skin, so other treatments are often preferred in light-skinned patients. It has a role as a leprostatic drug, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a dye. It is a member of phenazines and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is a phenazine dye with anti-mycobacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The exact mechanism through which it exerts its effect is unknown. However, it binds preferentially to mycobacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and cell growth. it has a slow bactericidal effect on Mycobacterium leprae and is active against various other Mycobacteria.
