N1-(alpha-D-Ribosyl)-5, 6-dimethyl-benzimidazole, also known as it or 5, 6-dimethyl-1-a-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzimidazole ribonucleosides and ribonucleotides. These are nucleosides with a structure that consists of an imidazole moiety of benzimidazole is N-linked to a ribose (or deoxyribose). Nucleotides have a phosphate group linked to the C5 carbon of the ribose (or deoxyribose) moiety. N1-(alpha-D-Ribosyl)-5, 6-dimethyl-benzimidazole is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa).
