it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthoquinones. Naphthoquinones are compounds containing a naphthohydroquinone moiety, which consists of a benzene ring linearly fused to a bezene-1, 4-dione (quinone). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
