it is a hydrate that is the monohydrate of cilazapril. It is used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and a prodrug. It contains a cilazapril. it is a pyridazine angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, cilazapril is rapidly metabolized in the liver to cilazaprilat; cilazaprilat competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation. Cilazaprilat also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
