3-Methyl-3H-imidazo[4, 5-F]quinoxalin-2-amine, also known as Iqx or 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4, 5-F)quinoxaline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quinoxalines. Quinoxalines are compounds containing a quinoxaline moiety, a bicyclic heterocycle made up of a benzene ring fused to a pyrazine ring. 3-Methyl-3H-imidazo[4, 5-F]quinoxalin-2-amine is slightly soluble (in water) and a strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4, 5-F]quinoxalin-2-amine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
