it is propargyl alcohol in which the methylene hydrogens are substituted by ethyl and 2-chlorovinyl groups. A hypnotic and sedative, it is used for treatment of insomnia in some cases where an intolerance or allergy to more commonly used drugs exists. It has a role as a sedative. It is a tertiary alcohol, an organochlorine compound, an enyne and a terminal acetylenic compound. it is a member of the class of tertiary carbinols with sedative and hypnotic properties. it appears to depress the central nervous system by binding at a benzodiazepine-GABA-A-chloride ionophore receptor complex, located in the limbic, thalamic and hypothalamic regions of the central nervous system (CNS). This increases the frequency of chloride channel opening, allowing the flow of chloride ions into the neuron and ultimately leading to membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in neuronal excitability.
