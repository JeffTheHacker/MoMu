it appears as colorless crystals that discolor on exposure to light and air. (NTP, 1992) it is an aminobenzoic acid in which the amino group is para to the carboxy group. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a plant metabolite and an allergen. It derives from a benzoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-aminobenzoate. Aminobenzoic Acid is an organic acid with UV absorption and antifibrotic properties. When exposed to light, aminobenzoic acid (it or it) absorbs UV light and emits excess energy via a photochemical reaction that may cause damage to DNA. Because DNA defects contribute to skin cancer, aminobenzoic acid is no longer widely used in sunscreen formulations. Aminobenzoic acid may also increase oxygen uptake at the tissue level and may enhance monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity to promote the degradation of serotonin, which in excess, may lead to fibrotic changes.
