it, also known as L-glycero-D-manno-it or perseitol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sugar alcohols. These are hydrogenated forms of carbohydrate in which the carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone, reducing sugar) has been reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, D-glycero-D-galacto-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, D-glycero-D-galacto-it can be found in avocado and mushrooms. This makes D-glycero-D-galacto-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
