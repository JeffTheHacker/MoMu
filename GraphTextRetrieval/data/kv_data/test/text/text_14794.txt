it is a ginsenoside found in Panax ginseng that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 6alpha, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy groups at positions 6 and 20 have been converted to the corresponding alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and beta-D-glucopyranoside respectively, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antioxidant, a neuroprotective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antineoplastic agent and a nephroprotective agent. It is a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a beta-D-glucoside, a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a disaccharide derivative and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid.
