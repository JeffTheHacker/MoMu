2-Methylbut-2-enoic acid, also known as 2-methylcrotonic acid or a-methylcrotonate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methyl-branched fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an acyl chain that has a methyl branch. Usually, they are saturated and contain only one or more methyl group. However, branches other than methyl may be present. 2-Methylbut-2-enoic acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). 2-Methylbut-2-enoic acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-methylbut-2-enoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome. 2-Methylbut-2-enoic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 2-methylbut-2-enoic acid can be biosynthesized from 2-butenoic acid. 2-Methylbut-2-enoic acid can also be converted into 2-methylbut-2-enoyl-coenzyme A.
