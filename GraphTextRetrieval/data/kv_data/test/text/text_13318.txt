it is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It is used, commonly as a hydrate, to treat hyperphosphataemia (excess phosphate in the blood) in patients with kidney disease: the calcium ion combines with dietary phosphate to form (insoluble) calcium phosphate, which is excreted in the faeces. It has a role as a chelator. It contains an acetate. it is a calcium salt of acetic acid. Calcium is a mineral essential for many cellular functions including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, cardiac function, bone formation, and capillary and cell membrane permeability. it is administered orally to prevent or treat calcium deficiency and to treat hyperphosphatemia due to its phosphate-binding properties.
