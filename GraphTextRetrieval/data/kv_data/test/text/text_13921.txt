Methotrexate disodium is an organic sodium salt that is the disodium salt of methotrexate. It has a role as an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor. It contains a methotrexate(2-). it is the sodium salt of methotrexate, an antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunomodulating properties. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant properties. (NCI04)
