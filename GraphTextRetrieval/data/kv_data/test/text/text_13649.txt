it is the chloride salt form of esoxybutynin, the dextrorotary form of oxybutynin S isomer [S(+)-isomer], with antispasmodic activity. Esoxybutynin chloride exerts its antimuscarinic effect on bladder smooth muscle by blocking muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle, thereby inhibiting acetylcholine binding. This results in a relaxation of bladder smooth muscle, a reduction of involuntary muscle contractions and delays the initial desire to void.
