it, also known as lithocholic acid glucuronide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroid glucuronide conjugates. These are sterol lipids containing a glucuronide moiety linked to the steroid skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human hepatic tissue, liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
