it is a purine nucleoside in which O-methylguanine is attached to arabinofuranose via a beta-N(9)-glycosidic bond. Inhibits DNA synthesis and causes cell death; a prodrug of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a DNA synthesis inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a purine nucleoside, a beta-D-arabinoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a guanine and a 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine. it is an arabinonucleoside antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. it is demethoxylated by adenosine deaminase to become biologically active 9-beta-D-arabinosylguanine (ara-G); ara-G incorporates into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing an S phase-dependent apoptosis of tumor cells.
