Acetylursolic acid, also known as acetylursolate or ursolic acid acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Acetylursolic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, acetylursolic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, acetylursolic acid can be found in a number of food items such as tea, japanese persimmon, common verbena, and rosemary. This makes acetylursolic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
