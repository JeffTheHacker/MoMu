it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenolic glycosides. These are organic compounds containing a phenolic structure attached to a glycosyl moiety. Some examples of phenolic structures include lignans, and flavonoids. Among the sugar units found in natural glycosides are D-glucose, L-Fructose, and L rhamnose. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it and uridine 5'-diphosphate can be biosynthesized from hydroxyphenytoin and uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-4, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-6, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9. In humans, it is involved in the metabolic disorder called the phenytoin (antiarrhythmic) action pathway.
