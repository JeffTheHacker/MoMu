it, also known as it or a-amino-p-cresol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylmethylamines. Phenylmethylamines are compounds containing a phenylmethtylamine moiety, which consists of a phenyl group substituted by an methanamine. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in brassicas and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
