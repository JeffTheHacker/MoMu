it is a broad-spectrum, carbapenem antibiotic with bactericidal and beta-lactamase resistant activities. it binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) located on the bacterial cell wall, particularly PBPs 2 and 3, thereby inhibiting the final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Inhibition results in a weakening and eventually lysis of the bacterial cell wall. This agent is two- to 16-fold more potent than imipenem and comparable to ertapenem and meropenem.
