it is an indene that is (3aS,7aR)-2,3,3a,4,5,7a-hexahydro-1H-indene which is substituted at the 2-pro-R position by a 1H-pyrrol-2-ylcarbonyl group, at the 9-pro-S position by an ethyl group, and at the 5-pro-R position by a hexa-1,3-dineyl group in which position 4 has been substituted by a (2R,3S,6R)-6-[(1R)-1-carboxyethyl]-3-methyltetrahydropyran-2-yl group. It exhibits activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well as antihypertensive and antitumour. It also functions as an effective growth promoter for ruminants. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antibacterial agent, an antineoplastic agent, an animal growth promotant, an ionophore, an antihypertensive agent and an insecticide.
