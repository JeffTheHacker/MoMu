it is a symmetrical oxalamide-based bis-quaternary ammonium salt having ethyl and 2-chlorobenzyl groups attached to the nitrogens. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and a neurotransmitter agent. It is a quaternary ammonium salt and an organic chloride salt. it is the chloride salt form of ambenonium, a quaternary ammonium compound with parasympathomimetic activity. it is a rapid indirect-acting cholinergic agonist that reversibly blocks the activity of acetylcholinesterase, thereby prevents acetylcholine hydrolysis and prolonging its activity on nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
