Uridine diphosphategalactose, also known as UDP-D-galactopyranose or UDP galactose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrimidine nucleotide sugars. These are pyrimidine nucleotides bound to a saccharide derivative through the terminal phosphate group. Uridine diphosphategalactose is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Uridine diphosphategalactose has been found in human liver tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, uridine diphosphategalactose is primarily located in the cytoplasm and golgi. Uridine diphosphategalactose participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Uridine diphosphategalactose and glucose 1-phosphate can be converted into uridine diphosphate glucose and galactose 1-phosphate through the action of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Furthermore, D-Glucose and uridine diphosphategalactose can be converted into uridine 5'-diphosphate and Alpha-lactose; which is catalyzed by the enzyme lactose synthase. Furthermore, Uridine diphosphategalactose and D-glucose can be converted into uridine 5'-diphosphate and Alpha-lactose through the action of the enzyme Beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase 1. Finally, Uridine diphosphategalactose and glucose 1-phosphate can be converted into galactose 1-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose; which is catalyzed by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In humans, uridine diphosphategalactose is involved in the galactose metabolism pathway, lactose synthesis pathway, and the nucleotide sugars metabolism pathway. Uridine diphosphategalactose is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include glut-1 deficiency syndrome, the galactosemia pathway, the congenital disorder OF glycosylation CDG-iid pathway, and the galactosemia II (galk) pathway.
