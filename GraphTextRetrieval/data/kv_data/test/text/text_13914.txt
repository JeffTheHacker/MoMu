it is the mesylate salt form of fenoldopam, a benzazepine derivative with rapid-acting vasodilator activity. it is a racemic mixture of S- and R- isomers; the latter is responsible for the biological activity and has a significantly higher affinity for dopamine D1-like receptors (D1 and D5) as well as moderate affinity to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. This agent selectively activates the dopamine D1-like receptor, thereby causing vasodilatation and increasing renal perfusion.
