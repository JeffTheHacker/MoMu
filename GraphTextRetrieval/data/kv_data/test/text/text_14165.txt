it, also known as it or allylnitrile, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles. Nitriles are compounds having the structure RC#N; thus C-substituted derivatives of hydrocyanic acid, HC#N. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in brassicas. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
