3-(1, 1-Dimethylallyl)herniarin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as coumarins and derivatives. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a 1-benzopyran moiety with a ketone group at the C2 carbon atom (1-benzopyran-2-one). 3-(1, 1-Dimethylallyl)herniarin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3-(1, 1-dimethylallyl)herniarin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3-(1, 1-dimethylallyl)herniarin can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 3-(1, 1-dimethylallyl)herniarin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
