it is a fine white powder. Many ordinary rocks (feldspars) are aluminosilicates. Aluminosilicates with more open three-dimensional structures than the feldspars are called zeolites. The openings in zeolites appear as polyhedral cavities connected by tunnels. Zeolites act as catalysts by absorbing small molecules in their interior cavities and holding them in proximity so that reaction among them occurs sooner.
