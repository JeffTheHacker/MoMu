3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-2-propenal, also known as it or 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylaldehyde, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cinnamaldehydes. These are organic aromatic compounds containing a cinnamlaldehyde moiety, consisting of a benzene and an aldehyde group to form 3-phenylprop-2-enal. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-2-propenal exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenal is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-2-propenal is a sweet, cherry, and cinnamon tasting compound that can be found in potato, star anise, sweet basil, and tarragon. This makes 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenal a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
