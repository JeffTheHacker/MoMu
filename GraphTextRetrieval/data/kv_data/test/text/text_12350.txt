5-Isopropylbicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexan-2-one, also known as 5-(1-methylethyl)-bicyclo(3. 1. 0)hexan-2-one or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ketones. These are organic compounds in which a carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms R2C=O (neither R may be a hydrogen atom). Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. 5-Isopropylbicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexan-2-one is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-isopropylbicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexan-2-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 5-isopropylbicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexan-2-one can be found in herbs and spices and root vegetables. This makes 5-isopropylbicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexan-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
