Pranlukast, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as chromones. Chromones are compounds containing a benzopyran-4-one moiety. Pranlukast is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Pranlukast has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, pranlukast is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
