Developed by Achaogen biopharmaceuticals, it is a next-generation aminoglycoside synthetically derived from [DB12604]. The structure of it was established via appending hydroxylaminobutyric acid to [DB12604] at position 1 and 2-hydroxyethyl group at position 6'. It was designed to evade all clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, which contribute to the main resistance mechanism for aminoglycoside therapy. However, acquired resistance of aminoglycosides may arise through over expression of efflux pumps and ribosomal modification by bacteria, which results from amino acid or rRNA sequence mutations. Like other aminoglycosides, it is ineffective against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. it mediates the antibacterial activity against pathogens including carbapenem-resistant (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. It mediates the antibacterial activity by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis. On June 28th, 2018, it sulfate was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including Pyelonephritis. It is marketed as Zemdri and is administered via once-daily intravenous infusion.
