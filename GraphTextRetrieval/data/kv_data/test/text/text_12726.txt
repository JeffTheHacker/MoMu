it is a hydrochloride that is the monohydrochloride salt of retaspimycin. A semi-synthetic water-soluble analogue of geldanamycin used in cancer treatment. It has a role as a Hsp90 inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It contains a retaspimycin(1+). Retaspimycin Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt of a small-molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) with antiproliferative and antineoplastic activities. Retaspimycin binds to and inhibits the cytosolic chaperone functions of HSP90, which maintains the stability and functional shape of many oncogenic signaling proteins and may be overexpressed or overactive in tumor cells. Retaspimycin-mediated inhibition of HSP90 promotes the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins in susceptible tumor cell populations, which may result in the induction of apoptosis.
