Enfuvirtide is a synthetic 36-amino acid peptide consisting of N-acetyltyrosyl, threonyl, seryl, leucyl, isoleucyl, histidyl, seryl, leucyl, isoleucyl, alpha-glutamyl, alpha-glutamyl, seryl, glutaminyl, asparaginyl, glutaminyl, glutaminyl, alpha-glutamyl, lysyl, asparaginyl, alpha-glutamyl, alpha-glutamyl, alpha-glutamyl, leucyl, leucyl, alpha-glutamyl, leucyl, alpha-aspartyl, lysyl, tryptophyl, alanyl, seryl, leucyl, tryptophyl, asparaginyl, tryptophyl, and phenylalaninamide residues joined in sequence. An HIV fusion inhibitor, it was the first of a novel class of antiretroviral drugs used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It interferes with entry of HIV into cells by binding to the gp41 sub-unit of the viral envelope glycoprotein, so inhibiting fusion of viral and cellular membranes. It has a role as a HIV fusion inhibitor.
