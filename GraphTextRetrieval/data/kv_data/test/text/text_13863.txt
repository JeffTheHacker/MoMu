it is a carotenol that is beta,beta-carotene carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 3' (the 3R,3'S-diastereomer). It is rarely found in diet and is believed to be formed at the macula by metabolic transformations of ingested carotenoids. It has a role as an antioxidant, a marine metabolite, a human xenobiotic metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It derives from a hydride of a beta-carotene.
