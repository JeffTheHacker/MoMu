it is a benzochromenone that is 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[h]chromene-5,6-dione substituted by geminal methyl groups at position 2. Isolated from Tabebuia avellanedae, it exhibits antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory activities. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a benzochromenone and a member of orthoquinones. it is a poorly soluble, ortho-naphthoquinone with potential antineoplastic and radiosensitizing activity. it (b-lap) is bioactivated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), creating a futile oxidoreduction that generates high levels of superoxide. In turn, the highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with DNA, thereby causing single-strand DNA breaks and calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Eventually, the extensive DNA damage causes hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme facilitating DNA repair, accompanied by rapid depletion of NAD+/ATP nucleotide levels. As a result, a caspase-independent and ER-stress induced mu-calpain-mediated cell death occurs in NQO1-overexpressing tumor cells. NQO1, a flavoprotein and two-electron oxidoreductase, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors.
