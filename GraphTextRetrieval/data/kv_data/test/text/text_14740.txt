(7R*, 8R*)-3-methoxy-3', 4, 7, 9, 9'-pentahydroxy-8, 4'-oxyneolignan belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lignans, neolignans and related compounds. These are plant products of low molecular weight formed primarily from oxidative coupling of two p-propylphenol moieties. They can also be described as micromolecules with two phenylpropanoid units coupled together. They can be attached in various manners, like C5-C5', C8-C8'. Most known natural lignans are oxidized at C9 and C9Â´ and, based upon the way in which oxygen is incorporated into the skeleton and on the cyclization patterns, a wide range of lignans of very different structural types can be formed (7R*, 8R*)-3-methoxy-3', 4, 7, 9, 9'-pentahydroxy-8, 4'-oxyneolignan is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (7R*, 8R*)-3-methoxy-3', 4, 7, 9, 9'-pentahydroxy-8, 4'-oxyneolignan is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
