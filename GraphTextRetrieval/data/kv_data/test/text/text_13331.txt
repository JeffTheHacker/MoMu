it appears as a colorless gas. Noncombustible but accelerates the burning of combustible material. Vapors heavier than air. Very toxic by inhalation and skin absorption. Heating the containers may cause them to rupture violently and rocket. it is a nitrogen oxide which is a free radical, each molecule of which consists of one nitrogen and one oxygen atom. It has a role as a neurotransmitter, a signalling molecule, a vasodilator agent, a bronchodilator agent, a radical scavenger, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a nitrogen oxide, an inorganic radical, a member of reactive nitrogen species and a member of reactive oxygen species. it is an unstable free-radical gas which reacts rapidly with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. Water soluble, NO is produced normally in numerous tissues and is considered to be a mediator of cell-to cell communication; it functions in numerous processes including vasodilation, inflammation, and neurotransmission.
