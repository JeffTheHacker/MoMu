it is a third generation, synthetic, water-soluble, pentapeptide analog of the marine depsipeptide dolastatin 15, with potential antimitotic and antineoplastic activities. it and its metabolite, it C-carboxylate, suppress the dynamic instability behavior of the microtubules through a reduction of the shortening rate (disassembly); reduction of the switching frequency from growth to shortening; and by reducing microtubules growth time. This may eventually result in a reduction of cell growth.
