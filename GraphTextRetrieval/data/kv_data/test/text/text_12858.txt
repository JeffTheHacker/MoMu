it is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a 2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl group, while the other is substituted by a p-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl group. It is a potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is an aromatic amine, a member of indazoles and a member of phenylureas. it is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor families; it exhibits much less activity against unrelated RTKs, soluble tyrosine kinases, or serine/threonine kinases. This agent does not have a general antiproliferative effect due to its high dose requirement. However, it may exhibit potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3).
