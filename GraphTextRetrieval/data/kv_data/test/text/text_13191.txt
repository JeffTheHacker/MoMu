it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme. It is a proprietary first-in-class small molecule with the potential to treat multiple solid tumours like the well known chemotherapeutics, doxorubicin and mitomycin C. it is a natural product derived from a non-pathogenic micro-organism. Discovered using Thallionâs DECIPHER technology, it has completed preclinical studies conducted by the National Cancer Institute and Thallion to establish safety and efficacy in animal and in vitro models. it is a potent inhibitor of the RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathway with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits Ras kinase, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and activation of proteins downstream of the Ras signal transduction pathway, including serine/threonine kinase RAF (BRAF) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK-2), that play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and survival. it also selectively binds to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (BZRP), a receptor highly expressed in certain cancer cells, thus inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BZRP-expressing cells. In addition, it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby reaching therapeutic concentrations in the brain.
