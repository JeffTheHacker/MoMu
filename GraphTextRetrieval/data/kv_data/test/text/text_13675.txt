it is an optically active form of ofloxacin having (S)-configuration; an inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase It has a role as a DNA synthesis inhibitor, an antibacterial drug and a topoisomerase IV inhibitor. It is an ofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. it is a broad-spectrum, third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic and optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin with antibacterial activity. it diffuses through the bacterial cell wall and acts by inhibiting DNA gyrase (bacterial topoisomerase II), an enzyme required for DNA replication, RNA transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Inhibition of DNA gyrase activity leads to blockage of bacterial cell growth.
