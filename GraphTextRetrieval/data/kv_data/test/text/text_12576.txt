it, also known as arduan or pipecurium bromide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoflavanols. These are polycyclic compounds containing a hydroxylated isoflavan skeleton. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as yellow wax bean, scarlet bean, pulses, and common bean. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
