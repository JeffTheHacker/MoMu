21-Deoxycortisol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gluco/mineralocorticoids, progestogins and derivatives. These are steroids with a structure based on a hydroxylated prostane moiety. 21-Deoxycortisol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 21-Deoxycortisol has been found in human hepatic tissue, testicle and endocrine gland tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as blood and urine. Within the cell, 21-deoxycortisol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 21-Deoxycortisol participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 21-Deoxycortisol can be converted into 11b-hydroxyprogesterone; which is catalyzed by the enzyme steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17, 20 lyase. In addition, 21-Deoxycortisol can be converted into cortisol through its interaction with the enzyme steroid 21-hydroxylase. In humans, 21-deoxycortisol is involved in the steroidogenesis pathway. 21-Deoxycortisol is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome pathway, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (cyp21), corticosterone methyl oxidase I deficiency (cmo I), and corticosterone methyl oxidase II deficiency - cmo II.
