it is a pyrrolopyrimidine that is pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine substituted at position 4 by an N-methyl,N-(1-cyanoacetyl-4-methylpiperidin-3-yl)amino moiety. Used as its citrate salt to treat moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.2 (non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antirheumatic drug. It is a pyrrolopyrimidine, a N-acylpiperidine, a nitrile and a tertiary amino compound. it is an orally available inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAK), with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, it binds to JAK and prevents the activation of the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. This may decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, -7, -15, -21, interferon-alpha and -beta, and may prevent both an inflammatory response and the inflammation-induced damage caused by certain immunological diseases. JAK kinases are intracellular enzymes involved in signaling pathways affecting hematopoiesis, immunity and inflammation.
