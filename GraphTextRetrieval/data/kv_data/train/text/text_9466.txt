it is an acetate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the primary hydroxy group of fludrocortisone with acetic acid. A synthetic corticosteroid, it has glucocorticoid actions about 10 times as potent as hydrocortisone, while its mineralocorticoid actions are over 100 times as potent. It is used in partial replacement therapy for primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease and for the treatment of salt-losing adrenal hyperplasia. It is an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, an acetate ester, a mineralocorticoid, a 20-oxo steroid, a fluorinated steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a fludrocortisone. it is the acetate salt of a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid with antiinflammatory and antiallergic activities. As a glucocorticoid-receptor agonist, fludrocortisone binds to cytoplasmic receptors, translocates to the nucleus, and subsequently initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes such as lipocortins to inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Inhibition of PLA2 activity prevents the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor of eicosanoids such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes; eicosanoids are important mediators in the pro-inflammatory response mechanism. As a mineralocorticoid-receptor agonist, this agent stimulates Na+ reabsorption and water retention and K+ and H+ secretion in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney.
