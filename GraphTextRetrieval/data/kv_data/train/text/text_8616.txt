it is a lipophilic, non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, it is converted to two active metabolites, it diacid and 5-hydroxy it diacid, which competitively bind to and inhibit ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
