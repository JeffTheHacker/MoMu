it is an alpha,omega dicarboxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with one of the carboxy groups of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an omega-carboxyacyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a glutaryl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid.
