Delta-Nonyl-valeralactone, also known as it or D-tetradecalactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as delta valerolactones. These are cyclic organic compounds containing an oxan-2- one moiety. Thus, Delta-nonyl-valeralactone is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. Delta-Nonyl-valeralactone exists as a liquid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Delta-nonyl-valeralactone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Delta-Nonyl-valeralactone is a sweet, creamy, and dairy tasting compound that can be found in fats and oils and milk and milk products. This makes Delta-nonyl-valeralactone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
