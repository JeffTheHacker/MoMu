Theasapogenol a, also known as protoescigenin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Theasapogenol a exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, theasapogenol a is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, theasapogenol a can be found in tea. This makes theasapogenol a a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
