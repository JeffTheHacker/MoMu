it appears as white to nearly-white microcrystalline powder or granules. Odorless. Melting point 211-212Â°C. Aqueous solutions are slightly alkaline. Slightly bitter, numbing taste. (R)-it is the R-enantiomer of it. It is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands resulting in the 'fight-or-flight' response. It has a role as a hormone, an adrenergic agonist, a vasodilator agent, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a bronchodilator agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a beta-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent, a mydriatic agent and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a (R)-it(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (S)-it. Therapeutic it is the synthetic form of the naturally occurring sympathomimetic amine with vasoconstricting, intraocular pressure-reducing, and bronchodilating activities. By stimulating vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors, it causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing vascular resistance and blood pressure. When administered in the conjunctiva, this agent binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, a decrease in the production of aqueous humor, and a lowering of intraocular pressure. Through its beta1 receptor-stimulating actions, it increases the force and rate of myocardial contraction and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation.
