it is an anthracycline antibiotic that is produced by Streptomyces galilaeus and also has potent antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and a bacterial metabolite. It is an anthracycline, an aminoglycoside, a trisaccharide derivative, a polyketide, a member of phenols, a methyl ester and a member of tetracenequinones. It derives from an aklavinone. It is a conjugate base of an aclacinomycin A(1+). It is a tautomer of an aclacinomycin A zwitterion. it is an oligosaccharide anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces galilaeus. it intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerases I and II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. it is antagonistic to other agents that inhibit topoisomerase II, such as etoposide, teniposide and amsacrine. This agent is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin and daunorubicin.
