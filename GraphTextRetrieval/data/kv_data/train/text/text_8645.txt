it is an imidazole compound having a 2,2-bis(phosphono)-2-hydroxyethane-1-yl substituent at the 1-position. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent. It is a member of imidazoles and a 1,1-bis(phosphonic acid). Anhydrous form of a synthetic imidazole third generation bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate with antiresorptive activity. it binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix and inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate (diphosphate) synthase, thereby preventing protein prenylation within the mevalonate pathway. This leads to the loss of downstream metabolites essential for osteoclast function, leading to the induction of apoptosis and eventually, osteoclast-cell death. By preventing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, zoledronate decreases bone turnover and stabilizes the bone matrix.
