it is a Paramagnetic Contrast Agent. The mechanism of action of it is as a Magnetic Resonance Contrast Activity. it is an injectable, intravascular, amphiphilic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) imaging. it is a stable gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) chelate derivative with a diphenylcyclohexylphosphate group. Upon injection, it binds reversibly to endogenous serum albumin which increases its intravascular retention time compared to non-protein binding contrast agents. The serum albumin binding also increases T1-relaxivity of it. This produces an increase in signal intensity of blood, thereby enhancing the visualization of blood vessels upon MRA and may aid in the diagnosis of certain blood vessels and heart disorders.
