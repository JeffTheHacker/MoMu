it is the L-enantiomer of the sulfur-containing amino acid cystine. It has a role as a flour treatment agent, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a mouse metabolite and an EC 1.2.1.12 (aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) inhibitor. It is a cystine, a L-cysteine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it anion. It is an enantiomer of a D-cystine. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. Not considered one of the 20 amino acids, Cystine is a sulfur-containing derivative obtained from oxidation of cysteine amino acid thiol side chains. It functions as an antioxidant and protects tissues against radiation and pollution, slowing the aging process. It also aids protein synthesis. Cystine is abundant in many proteins of skeletal tissues and skin, and found in insulin and digestive enzymes chromotrypsinogen A, papain, and trypsinogen. (NCI04)
