it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as kaurane diterpenoids. These are diterpene alkaloids with a structure that is based on the kaurane skeleton. Kaurane is a tetracyclic compound that arises by cyclisation of a pimarane precursor followed by rearrangement. It possesses a [3, 2, 1]-bicyclic ring system with C15-C16 bridge connected to C13, forming the five-membered ring D. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
