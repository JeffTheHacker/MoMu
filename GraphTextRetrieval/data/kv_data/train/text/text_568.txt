1, 2, 4-Trithiolane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trithiolanes. These are organic compounds containing a six-member aliphatic saturated heterocycle made up of three sulfur atoms and two carbon atoms. Within the cell, 1, 2, 4-trithiolane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 4-trithiolane can be found in green vegetables and mushrooms. This makes 1, 2, 4-trithiolane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
