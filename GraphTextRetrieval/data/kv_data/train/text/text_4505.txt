it is the maleate salt form of quipazine, a piperazine-based nonselective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist with antidepressant and oxytocic activities. Quipazine targets and binds to serotonin receptors, particularly to the 5HT2A and 5HT3 receptors. Serotonin receptor activation by quipazine may lead to smooth muscle contraction and antidepressant effects.
