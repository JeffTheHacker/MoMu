it is a quaternary ammonium salt composed of 3-{[cyclopentyl(hydroxy)phenylacetyl]oxy}-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidin-1-ium and bromide ions in a 1:1 ratio. It is a quaternary ammonium salt and an organic bromide salt. it is a synthetic quaternary ammonium that is an anticholinergic agent with antispasmodic activity. it competitively binds to peripheral muscarinic receptors in the autonomic effector cells of, and inhibits cholinergic transmission in smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, exocrine glands and in the autonomic ganglia. Blockage of cholinergic transmission, in smooth muscle cells located in the gastrointestinal tract and the bladder, causes smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the occurrence of painful spasms. In addition, it inhibits the release of gastric, pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions.
