it is a branched heptasaccharide derivative consisting of a D-GlcNAc residue at the reducing end with a D-Man-alpha(1->6)-[D-Xyl-beta(1->2)-D-Man-alpha(1->3)]-D-Man-beta(1->4)-GlcNAc moiety attached via a beta-(1->4)-linkage and an L-Fuc residue attached via an alpha-(1->3)-linkage. It has a role as a carbohydrate allergen.
