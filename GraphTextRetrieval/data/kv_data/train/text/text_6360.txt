it is a hydrazine in which each nitrogen atom is substituted, one by a 3'-carboxy-2-hydroxy[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl group and the other by a 1-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-3-methyl-5-oxo-1,5-dihydro-4H-pyrazol-4-ylidene group. A small molecule agonist of the c-mpl (TpoR) receptor (the physiological target of the hormone thrombopoietin), it has been developed as a medication for conditions that lead to thrombocytopenia (abnormally low platelet counts). It has a role as a thrombopoietin receptor agonist and a xenobiotic. It is a member of hydrazines, a member of pyrazoles and a member of benzoic acids. it is an orally active thrombopoietin receptor agonist with megakaryopoiesis stimulating activity. it binds to and stimulates the platelet thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R or CD110), a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. Activation of TPO-R leads to the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, thereby increasing the production of blood platelets.
