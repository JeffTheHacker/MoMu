Ecgonine methyl ester, also known as methyl ecgonine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tropane alkaloids. These are organic compounds containing the nitrogenous bicyclic alkaloid parent N-Methyl-8-azabicyclo[3. 2. 1]octane. Ecgonine methyl ester is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Ecgonine methyl ester has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, ecgonine methyl ester is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum.
