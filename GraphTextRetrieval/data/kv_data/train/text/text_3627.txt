6, 6-Dimethoxy-2, 5, 5-trimethyl-2-hexene, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetals. Acetals are compounds having the structure R2C(OR')2 ( R' not Hydrogen) and thus diethers of geminal diols. Originally, the term was confined to derivatives of aldehydes (one R = H), but it now applies equally to derivatives of ketones (neither R = H ). Mixed acetals have different R' groups. 6, 6-Dimethoxy-2, 5, 5-trimethyl-2-hexene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 6, 6-dimethoxy-2, 5, 5-trimethyl-2-hexene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 6, 6-Dimethoxy-2, 5, 5-trimethyl-2-hexene has a citrus, fresh, and grapefruit peel taste.
