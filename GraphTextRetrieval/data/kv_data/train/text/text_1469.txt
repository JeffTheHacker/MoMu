it is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of pyrazinoic acid (pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid) with ammonia. A prodrug for pyrazinoic acid, it is used as part of multidrug regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis. It has a role as an antitubercular agent and a prodrug. It is a member of pyrazines, a N-acylammonia and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a synthetic it derivative with bactericidal property. it is particularly active against slowly multiplying intracellular bacilli (unaffected by other drugs) by an unknown mechanism of action. Its bactericidal action is dependent upon the presence of bacterial pyrazinamidase, which removes the amide group to produce active pyrazinoic acid. it is an important component of multidrug therapy for tuberculosis.
