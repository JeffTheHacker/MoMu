it is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid 1,1-dioxide with the exocyclic nitrogen of 2-aminopyridine. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the oxicam class, it is used to relieve pain and works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins involved in the mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. It has a role as an analgesic, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor and an antirheumatic drug. It is a benzothiazine, a member of pyridines and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a nonsteroidal oxicam derivative with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties. As a non-selective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it binds and chelates both isoforms of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2), thereby stalling phospholipase A2 activity and conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin precursors at the rate limiting cyclooxygenase enzyme step. This results in inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. As a second, independent effect, it inhibits the activation of neutrophils thereby contributing to its overall anti-inflammatory effects.
