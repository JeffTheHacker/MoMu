it is a 2'-deoxycytidine having geminal fluoro substituents in the 2'-position. An inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, it is used in the treatment of various carcinomas, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer. It has a role as a photosensitizing agent, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, a prodrug, an EC 1.17.4.1 (ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a radiosensitizing agent, an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an antiviral drug and an immunosuppressive agent. It is an organofluorine compound and a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside. it is a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in masked termination during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.
