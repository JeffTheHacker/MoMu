it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. Thus, it is considered to be an isoprenoid lipid molecule. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a sweet, balsam, and medical tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as spearmint, rosemary, sweet bay, and cumin. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
