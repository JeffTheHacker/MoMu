it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT03572634 (Phase 1/2 Study of it (an Inhibitor of AXL Kinase) in Patients With Previously Treated CLL). it is an orally available and selective inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL (UFO), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, dubermatinib targets and binds to AXL and prevents its activity. This blocks AXL-mediated signal transduction pathways and inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which, in turn, inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration. In addition, it enhances chemo-sensitivity to certain other chemotherapeutic agents. AXL, a member of the Tyro3, AXL and Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases and overexpressed by many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.
