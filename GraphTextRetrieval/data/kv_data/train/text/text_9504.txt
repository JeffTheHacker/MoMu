it is a member of the class of isoindoles that is isoindole in which the amino group has been acylated by a 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropylbenzoyl group and in which position 5 of the isoidole moiety has been substituted by a (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl group. A second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor. It has a role as a Hsp90 inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of resorcinols, a member of benzamides, a tertiary carboxamide, a member of isoindoles and a N-alkylpiperazine. it is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to Hsp90, thereby inhibiting its chaperone function and promoting the degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. Hsp90, a chaperone protein upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, regulates the folding, stability and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins.
