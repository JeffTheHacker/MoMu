it is an imidazolidine-2,4-dione (hydantoin) in which the imidazolidine nucleus carries a methyl group at N-3 and has ethyl and phenyl substituents at C-5. An anticonvulsant, it is no longer available in the USA or the UK but is still studied largely because of its interesting hydroxylation polymorphism. It has a role as an anticonvulsant. it is a heterocyclic organic compound with anticonvulsant property. Although the mechanism of action is not well established, it potentially promotes sodium efflux from neurons in motor cortex, and stabilizes the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation. Thus this agent reduces the membrane sodium gradient and prevents cortical seizure signal spreading. It may cause blood dyscrasias, therefore, this agent was only used after other less toxic anticonvulsants had failed.
