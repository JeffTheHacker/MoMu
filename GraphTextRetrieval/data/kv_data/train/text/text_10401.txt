it is an acetate salt obtained by combining histrelin with acetic acid. The amount of acetic acid present can vary and a variable amount of water may be present. it is used as a subcutaneous hydrogel implant for the treatment of prostate cancer and for the suppression of gonadal sex hormone production in children with central precocious puberty. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist. It contains a histrelin. Histrelin Acetate is the acetate salt form of histrelin, a long-acting, synthetic nonapeptide analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) with potential anti-tumor activity. Upon administration, histrelin binds to and activates GnRH receptors; prolonged administration results in pituitary GnRH receptor desensitization and inhibition of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, leading to a significant decline in testosterone production in males and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression; in females, prolonged administration results in decreased estradiol production.
