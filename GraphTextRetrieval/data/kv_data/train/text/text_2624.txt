it is an odorless white to creamy white crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a 3-oxo-5alpha- steroid that is 4,5alpha-dihydrotestosterone which is substituted by a hydroxymethylidene group at position 2 and by a methyl group at the 17alpha position. A synthetic androgen, it was mainly used for the treatment of anaemias until being replaced by treatments with fewer side effects. It has a role as an anabolic agent, an androgen and an anti-anaemic agent. It is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, an enone, a tertiary alcohol, an enol, an anabolic androgenic steroid and a 3-oxo-5alpha-steroid. it is an orally active synthetic anabolic steroid and a 17alpha-methylated derivative of dihydrotestosterone, with androgenic activity. Although it has low affinity for binding the androgen receptor (AR), it strongly activates AR-mediated signaling, which stimulates both protein synthesis and erythropoietin production. This agent may stimulate muscle growth, induce hemoglobin production and red blood cell formation, and promote increased bone density.
