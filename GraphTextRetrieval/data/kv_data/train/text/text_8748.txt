Smilagenone, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Smilagenone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Smilagenone has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, smilagenone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, smilagenone can be found in root vegetables. This makes smilagenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
