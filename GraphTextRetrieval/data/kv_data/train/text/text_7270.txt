it is an adenosine analogue that has been investigated for use against Zaire Ebolavirus. In animal studies, it was effective in increasing the survival rates from infections caused by various pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses. In vitro, it displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and arenaviruses. Phase 1 clinical trials have begun to determine the safety of this drug in humans. Because of its activity against other coronaviruses, it may be studied as a potential therapy for COVID-19.
