L-it, also known as 6-deoxy-L-mannose or L-mannomethylose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. L-it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). L-it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as blood and urine. Within the cell, L-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
