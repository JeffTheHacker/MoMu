(-)-Quebrachamine, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quebrachamine alkaloids. These are alkaloids with a structure based on the quebrachamine skeleton, a tetracyclic compound that is derived by fission of the 7, 21 bond of the aspidospermidine skeleton. Some quebrachamine alkaloids lack the C-16 methoxycarbonyl group (-)-Quebrachamine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (-)-quebrachamine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) (-)-Quebrachamine has a bitter taste.
