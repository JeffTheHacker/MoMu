it is a ginsenoside found in Panax species that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer, a cardioprotective agent, a bone density conservation agent and a hepatoprotective agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a 20-hydroxy steroid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
