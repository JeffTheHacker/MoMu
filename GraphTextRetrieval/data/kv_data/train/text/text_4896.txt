it is an imidazotetrazine that is 3,4-dihydroimidazo[5,1-d][1,2,3,5]tetrazine which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 8 by methyl, oxo, and carboxamide groups, respectively. A prodrug for MTIC (5-(3-methyltriaz-1-en-1-yl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide, formed by spontaneous hydrolysis of it in the body), it is used as an oral alkylating agent for the treatment of newly diagnosed malignant glioblastoma multiforme (concomitantly with radiotherapy) and malignant melanoma. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a prodrug and an alkylating agent. It is an imidazotetrazine, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a triazene derivative. it is a triazene analog of dacarbazine with antineoplastic activity. As a cytotoxic alkylating agent, it is converted at physiologic pH to the short-lived active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due primarily to methylation of DNA at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication. Unlike dacarbazine, which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, it is metabolized to MITC at all sites. it is administered orally and penetrates well into the central nervous system. (NCI04)
