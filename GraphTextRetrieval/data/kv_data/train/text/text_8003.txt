it, also known as (e)-it or fema 3594, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a fresh, ozone, and pine tasting compound that can be found in hyssop, rosemary, spearmint, and wild celery. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
