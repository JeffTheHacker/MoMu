it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as coumarins and derivatives. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a 1-benzopyran moiety with a ketone group at the C2 carbon atom (1-benzopyran-2-one). it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, coumarin-4-carboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, coumarin-4-carboxylic acid can be found in herbs and spices and tea. This makes coumarin-4-carboxylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
