Budotitane is a titanium metal complex, coordinated with asymmetric beta-diketonate ligands, with antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, budotitane potentially binds either to macromolecules via coordinative covalent bonds, or via intercalation between nucleic acids strands by the aromatic ring of the beta-diketonate. In addition, this agent appears to cause cardiac arrhythmias and is toxic to the liver and kidneys at higher doses. The development of budotitane was halted due to the rapid loss of its labile groups under physiological conditions.
