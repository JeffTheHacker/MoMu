it, also known as sulfate, chondroitin or blutal, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glucuronides. These are glucuronides in which the aglycone is linked to the carbohydrate unit through an O-glycosidic bond. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, chondroitin sulfate is primarily located in the cytoplasm and myelin sheath.
