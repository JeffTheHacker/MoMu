2, 4, 6-Trihydroxybenzoic acid, also known as phloroglucincarboxylic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives are compounds containing a hydroxybenzoic acid (or a derivative), which is a benzene ring bearing a carboxyl and a hydroxyl groups. 2, 4, 6-Trihydroxybenzoic acid exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoic acid can be found in garden onion and onion-family vegetables. This makes 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
