it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Anemia and Non-dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease. it is an orally bioavailable, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor (HIF-PHI), with potential anti-anemic and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, it binds to and inhibits HIF-PH, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of transcription factors in the HIF family under normal oxygen conditions. This prevents HIF breakdown and promotes HIF activity. Increased HIF activity leads to an increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, thereby enhancing erythropoiesis. It also reduces the expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin, improves iron availability, and boosts hemoglobin (Hb) levels. HIF regulates the expression of genes in response to reduced oxygen levels, including genes required for erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. In addition, HIF 1-alpha (HIF1A) may play a role in reducing inflammation during acute lung injury (ALI) through HIF-dependent control of glucose metabolism in the alveolar epithelium.
