it is a homodetic cyclic peptide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N(2)-(3-phenylpropanoyl)-L-ornithyl-L-prolyl-3-cyclohexyl-D-alanyl-L-tryptophyl-L-arginine with the 5-amino group of the N(2)-acylornithyl residue. It has a role as an antagonist, an anti-inflammatory agent and a C5a receptor antagonist. It is an azamacrocycle and a homodetic cyclic peptide.
