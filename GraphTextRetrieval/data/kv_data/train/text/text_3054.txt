All-trans-it is an it, a retinoid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It has a role as a keratolytic drug. it is an orally-active metabolite of the synthetic aromatic retinoic acid agent itate with potential antineoplastic, chemopreventive, anti-psoratic, and embryotoxic properties. it activates nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), resulting in induction of cell differentiation, inhibition of cell proliferation, and inhibition of tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells. This agent may also inhibit tumor angiogenesis. (NCI04)
