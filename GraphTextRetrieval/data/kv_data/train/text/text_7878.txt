it, solid is a white crystalline solid with an odor of chlorine. The material itself is noncombustible but if contaminated with a combustible material ignition can result. It will accelerate the burning of combustible materials. Contact with ammonium compounds or hydrated salts can cause a very vigorous chemical reaction. It may vigorously react with small quantities of water releasing chlorine gas. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat of the material may result in the vigorous decomposition of the material and the rupturing of its containers. Material containing less than 39 percent available chlorine will undergo reactions as described above though it may be longer to initiate and the resulting reaction may not be as vigorous. It is used as a dry bleach in household cleaning compounds and swimming pool disinfectants.
