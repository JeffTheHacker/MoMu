it is the hydrochloride salt of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, imidapril is converted by hydrolysis in the liver into its active form imidaprilat. Imidaprilat competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. Imidaprilat also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
