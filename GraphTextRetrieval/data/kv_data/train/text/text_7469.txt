1, 2, 4, 6-Tetrathiepane, also known as rocaglamide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dithioacetals. Dithioacetals are compounds containing a dithioacetal functional group with the general structure R2C(SR')2. 1, 2, 4, 6-Tetrathiepane exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 1, 2, 4, 6-tetrathiepane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 4, 6-tetrathiepane can be found in mushrooms. This makes 1, 2, 4, 6-tetrathiepane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
