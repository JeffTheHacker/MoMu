it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steviol glycosides. These are prenol lipids containing a carbohydrate moiety glycosidically linked to a steviol (a diterpenoid based on a 13-Hydroxykaur-16-en-18-oic acid) moiety. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, steviobioside is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
