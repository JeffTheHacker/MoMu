it is an organic heterotricyclic compound resulting from the formal condensation of the oxo group of cytidine to the 2' position with loss of water to give the corresponding cyclic ether. A prodrug, it is metabolised to the antineoplastic agent cytarabine, so is used to maintain a more constant antineoplastic action. It has a role as a prodrug, an antimetabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organic heterotricyclic compound and a diol. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a cytarabine congener prodrug with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it is slowly hydrolyzed into cytarabine, which is converted to the active triphosphate form and competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA. Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle. This agent also inhibits DNA and RNA polymerases, resulting in a decrease in cell growth. Compared to cytarabine, a more prolonged, consistent cytarabine-mediated therapeutic effect may be achieved with it because of the slow hydrolytic conversion of it to cytarabine.
