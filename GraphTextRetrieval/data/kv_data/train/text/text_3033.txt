Carbidopa is the hydrate of 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid in which the hydrogens alpha- to the carboxyl group are substituted by hydrazinyl and methyl groups (S-configuration). Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, so prevents conversion of levodopa to dopamine. It has no antiparkinson activity by itself, but is used in the management of Parkinson's disease to reduce peripheral adverse effects of levodopa. It has a role as an EC 4.1.1.28 (aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase) inhibitor, an antiparkinson drug, a dopaminergic agent and an antidyskinesia agent. It is a member of hydrazines, a hydrate, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of catechols. It contains a carbidopa (anhydrous). Carbidopa is a hydrazine derivative of dopa. Carbidopa is a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor that is used as an adjunct to levodopa administration to prevent peripheral biosynthesis of levodopa to dopamine, thereby reducing peripheral side effects. Carbidopa does not penetrate the blood brain barrier so that levodopa, after it reaches the brain, can be metabolized to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase where it exerts its effect on dopamine receptors.
