it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1H-benzimidazole which is substituted by a 8-(4-aminopiperidin-1-yl)quinolin-2-yl group at position 1 and by a (3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy group at position 5. It is an inhibitor of type III tyrosine kinases, PDGFRalpha/beta and FLT3 (IC50 of 11, 3.2, and 4 nM). Currently under clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a member of benzimidazoles, an aromatic ether, a member of quinolines, a member of oxetanes, an aminopiperidine and a tertiary amino compound. it is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) subtypes alpha and beta and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, it binds to and inhibits both wild-type and mutated forms of PDGFR and Flt3, which may result in the inhibition of PDGFR- and Flt3-related signal transduction pathways. This results in inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation in PDGFR and/or Flt3 overexpressing tumor cells. PDGFR and Flt3, class III receptor tyrosine kinases, are upregulated or mutated in many tumor cell types.
