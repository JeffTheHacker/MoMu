it, also known as it or 2-formylcarbazole (obsol. ), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carbazoles. Carbazoles are compounds containing a three ring system containing a pyrrole ring fused on either side to a benzene ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 9H-carbazole-3-carboxaldehyde is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 9H-carbazole-3-carboxaldehyde can be found in fruits. This makes 9H-carbazole-3-carboxaldehyde a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
