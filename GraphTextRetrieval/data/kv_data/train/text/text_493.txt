L-glutamic 5-semialdehyde is a glutamic semialdehyde arising from formal reduction of the side-chain carboxy group of L-glutamic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a tautomer of a L-glutamic 5-semialdehyde zwitterion.
