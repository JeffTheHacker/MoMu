it is a piperidinecarboxamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-butylpipecolic acid with the amino group of 2,6-dimethylaniline. It is a piperidinecarboxamide, an aromatic amide and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a 1-butyl-2-[(2,6-dimethylphenyl)carbamoyl]piperidinium. it is an amide-type, long-acting local anesthetic. Bupivicaine reversibly binds to specific sodium ion channels in the neuronal membrane, resulting in a decrease in the voltage-dependent membrane permeability to sodium ions and membrane stabilization; inhibition of depolarization and nerve impulse conduction; and a reversible loss of sensation.
