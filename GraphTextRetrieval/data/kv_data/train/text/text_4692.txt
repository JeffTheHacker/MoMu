it is a tetrahydroxyflavone in which the four hydroxy groups are located at positions 3', 4' 5 and 7. It is thought to play an important role in the human body as an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger, an inflammatory agent and an immune system modulator as well as being active against several cancers. It has a role as an EC 2.3.1.85 (fatty acid synthase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, a plant metabolite, a nephroprotective agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor, an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a 3'-hydroxyflavonoid and a tetrahydroxyflavone. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-olate it-7-olate(1-). it is a naturally-occurring flavonoid, with potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive activities. Upon administration, it scavenges free radicals, protects cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage and induces direct cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation and suppresses metastasis.
