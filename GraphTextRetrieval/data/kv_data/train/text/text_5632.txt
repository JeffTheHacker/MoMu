it is a hydrochloride resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of quinapril and hydrogen chloride. A prodrug for quinaprilat hydrochloride (by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester to the corresponding carboxylic acid), it is used as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It contains a quinapril(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of quinapril, a prodrug and non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Quinapril is hydrolized into its active form quinaprilat, which binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This abolishes the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. Quinapril also causes a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis, and increases bradykinin levels.
