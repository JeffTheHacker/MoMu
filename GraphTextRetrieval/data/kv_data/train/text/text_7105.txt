it is a dipeptide that is L-tryptophyl-L-leucinamide in which the N-terminal amino group has been converted to the corresponding (morpholin-4-yl)acetamide and in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen of the C-terminal amide has been replaced by a (1E)-5-methyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)hex-1-en-3-yl group. It is a selective proteasome inhibitor. It has a role as a proteasome inhibitor and an antimalarial. It is a dipeptide, a sulfone, a member of morpholines and a member of indoles. It derives from a Trp-Leu.
