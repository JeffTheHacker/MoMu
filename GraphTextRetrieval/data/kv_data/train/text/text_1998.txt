it is the methyl ester of 5-aminolevulinic acid. A prodrug, it is metabolised to protoporphyrin IX, a photosensitizer, and is used in the photodynamic treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer (including basal cell carcinoma). Topical application (often as the hydrochloride salt) results in an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. Subsequent illumination with red light results in the generation of toxic singlet oxygen that destroys cell membranes and thereby kills the tumour cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a photosensitizing agent, a prodrug and a dermatologic drug. It derives from a 5-aminolevulinic acid.
