it, also known as prolinal or proline aldehyde, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolidines. Pyrrolidines are compounds containing a pyrrolidine ring, which is a five-membered saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one nitrogen atom and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-pyrrolidinecarboxaldehyde is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
