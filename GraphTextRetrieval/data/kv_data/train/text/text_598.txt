it monomer appears as a clear colorless liquid. Slightly soluble in water and floats on water. Vapors heavier than air. Vapors irritate the eyes and respiratory system. Containers must be heavily insulated or shipped under refrigeration. An inhibitor such as hydroquinone, hydroquinone methyl ester and dimethyl t-butylphenol is added to keep the chemical from initiating polymerization. The chemical may polymerize exothermically if heated or contaminated with strong acid or base. If the polymerization takes place inside a container, the container may rupture violently. Used to make plastics. it is an enoate ester having methacrylic acid as the carboxylic acid component and methanol as the alcohol component. It has a role as an allergen and a polymerisation monomer. It is an enoate ester and a methyl ester. It derives from a methacrylic acid. it is a methyl ester of methacrylic acid. it is a reactive resin, and the polymerized form is used as cement in dentistry, orthopaedic surgery and ophthalmology. The monomer form of this agent has relaxation effect on smooth muscle systemically, which might be a result of nitric oxide-mediated response.
