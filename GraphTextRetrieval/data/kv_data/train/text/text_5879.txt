1-Methyl-4-(1-methyl-2-propenyl)-benzene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. 1-Methyl-4-(1-methyl-2-propenyl)-benzene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 1-Methyl-4-(1-methyl-2-propenyl)-benzene has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, 1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-2-propenyl)-benzene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
