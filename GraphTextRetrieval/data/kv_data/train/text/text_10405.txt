OxyELITE Pro is the commercial name for a variety of multi-ingredient nutritional supplements (MINS) marketed for weight loss and body building. In 2013, one of the OxyELITE Pro products called âSuper Thermogenicâ was withdrawn from use in the United States after it was implicated in more than 50 cases of acute hepatitis including several instances of fatal, acute liver failure.
