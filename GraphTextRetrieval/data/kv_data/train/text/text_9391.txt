Ciclesonide, also known as alvesco or omnaris, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gluco/mineralocorticoids, progestogins and derivatives. These are steroids with a structure based on a hydroxylated prostane moiety. Ciclesonide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Ciclesonide has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, ciclesonide is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
