3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-oxo-acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a 3-oxo acylated coenzyme A derivative. 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3a, 7a, 12a-trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA can be biosynthesized from 3a, 7a, 12a-trihydroxy-5b-cholestanoic acid through the action of the enzyme bile acyl-CoA synthetase. In addition, 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA can be converted into 3a, 7a, 12a-trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA through its interaction with the enzyme Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In humans, 3a, 7a, 12a-trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is involved in congenital bile acid synthesis defect type III pathway, the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) pathway, bile acid biosynthesis pathway, and congenital bile acid synthesis defect type II pathway. 3a, 7a, 12a-Trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include the zellweger syndrome pathway, 27-hydroxylase deficiency, and the familial hypercholanemia (fhca) pathway.
