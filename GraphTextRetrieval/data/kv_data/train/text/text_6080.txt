it is a benzoselenazole that is 1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one carrying an additional phenyl substituent at position 2. Acts as a mimic of glutathione peroxidase. It has a role as a neuroprotective agent, an apoptosis inducer, an anti-inflammatory drug, an antioxidant, a hepatoprotective agent, a genotoxin, a radical scavenger, an enzyme mimic, an EC 1.3.1.8 [acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (NADP(+))] inhibitor, an EC 1.8.1.12 (trypanothione-disulfide reductase) inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.33 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 2.5.1.7 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor, an EC 3.5.4.1 (cytosine deaminase) inhibitor and an EC 5.1.3.2 (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase) inhibitor. it is a organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity. it acts as a glutathione peroxidase mimetic and is thereby able to prevent cellular damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, this agent inhibits the activity of a variety of enzymes including nitric oxide synthase (NOS), 5-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, protein kinase C (PKC), NADPH oxidase and gastric H+/K+-ATPase. Furthermore, it may be neuroprotective due to its ability to neutralize free radicals upon NMDA receptor activation thus, reducing lipoperoxidation mediated by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.
