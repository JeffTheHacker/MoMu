it is an aldosterone receptor antagonist and potassium-sparing diuretic used in the therapy of hypertension. it therapy has been associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but has yet to be linked to cases of clinically apparent drug induced liver disease. it is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist. it binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone, thereby decreasing sodium resorption and subsequently increasing water outflow. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure. it is used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.
