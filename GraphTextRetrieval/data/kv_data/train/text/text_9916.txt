it is a phenethylamine derivative with tocolytic activity. it binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors of myometrial cells in the uterus, which decreases the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions. Specifically, it probably activates adenyl cyclase, thereby increasing production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn enhances the efflux of calcium from vascular smooth muscle cells. A lack of intracellular calcium prevents uterine myometrial contractions. In addition, this agent may directly inactivate myosin light chain kinase, a critical enzyme necessary for the initiation of muscle contractions.
