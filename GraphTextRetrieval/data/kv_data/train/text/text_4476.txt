it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the propanoate metabolism pathway. it is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include the malonic aciduria pathway, the methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders pathway, and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency.
