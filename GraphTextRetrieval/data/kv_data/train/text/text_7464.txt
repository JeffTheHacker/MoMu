it is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a 4-chloro-3-trifluorophenyl group while the other is substituted by a phenyl group which, in turn, is substituted at the para position by a [2-(methylcarbamoyl)pyridin-4-yl]oxy group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a pyridinecarboxamide, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an aromatic ether, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a member of phenylureas. it is a synthetic compound targeting growth signaling and angiogenesis. it blocks the enzyme RAF kinase, a critical component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that controls cell division and proliferation; in addition, it inhibits the VEGFR-2/PDGFR-beta signaling cascade, thereby blocking tumor angiogenesis.
