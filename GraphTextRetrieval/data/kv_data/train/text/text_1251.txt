it is an odorless colorless solid. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999) it is the D-enantiomer of it (also known as it). It has a role as a sweetening agent, a laxative, a metabolite, a cathartic, a human metabolite, a food humectant, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a L-it. it is a sugar alcohol found in fruits and plants with diuretic, laxative and cathartic property. Unabsorbed it retains water in the large intestine through osmotic pressure thereby stimulating peristalsis of the intestine and exerting its diuretic, laxative and cathartic effect. In addition, it has one-third fewer calories and 60 % the sweetening activity of sucrose and is used as a sugar replacement in diabetes.
