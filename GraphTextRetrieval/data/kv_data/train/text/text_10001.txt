Phosphoribosyl-ATP belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purine ribonucleoside triphosphates. These are purine ribobucleotides with a triphosphate group linked to the ribose moiety. Phosphoribosyl-ATP is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Phosphoribosyl-ATP exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, phosphoribosyl-ATP can be found in a number of food items such as black huckleberry, nance, devilfish, and pineappple sage. This makes phosphoribosyl-ATP a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
