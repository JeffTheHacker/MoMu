N-Acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate, also known as GLCNAC6P, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acylaminosugars. These are organic compounds containing a sugar linked to a chain through N-acyl group. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate can be found in a number of food items such as lupine, malabar spinach, lemon verbena, and cocoa bean. This makes N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
