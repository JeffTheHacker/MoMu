Piperitol, also known as it or fema 3179, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. Piperitol is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, piperitol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Piperitol is a herbal tasting compound that can be found in cumin, dill, and spearmint. This makes piperitol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
