it appears as an odorless white crystalline solid. Density 5.4 g / cm3. Melting point 277Â°C. Slightly volatile at ordinary temperatures. Can be sublimed unchanged. Corrosive to the mucous membranes. Toxic by inhalation (dusts, etc.), ingestion, and skin absorption. Used in photography, disinfectants, wood preservatives, fungicides. Mercury dichloride is a mercury coordination entity made up of linear triatomic molecules in which a mercury atom is bonded to two chlorines. Water-soluble, it is highly toxic. Once used in a wide variety of applications, including preserving wood and anatomical specimens, embalming and disinfecting, as an intensifier in photography, as a mordant for rabbit and beaver furs, and freeing gold from lead, its use has markedly declined as less toxic alternatives have been developed. It has a role as a sensitiser.
