it is the monohydrochloride salt of chloroprocaine. Used as a local anaesthetic, particularly for oral surgery, it has the advantage over lidocaine of constricting blood vessels, so reducing bleeding. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, a peripheral nervous system drug and a central nervous system depressant. It contains a chloroprocaine. it is a synthetic, aminoester, local, anesthetic agent. At the injection site, it acts by inhibiting sodium influx through binding to specific membrane sodium ion channels in the neuronal cell membranes, restricting sodium permeability, and blocking nerve impulse conduction. This leads to a loss of sensation. it is short-acting due to rapid hydrolysis by pseudocholinesterase into para-aminobenzoic acid in plasma.
