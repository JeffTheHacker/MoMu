1, 3, 7, 12-Tetrahydroxycholan-24-Oic acid, also known as 1, 3, 7, 12-thca or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrahydroxy bile acids, alcohols and derivatives. These are prenol lipids structurally characterized by a bile acid or alcohol which bears four hydroxyl groups. 1, 3, 7, 12-Tetrahydroxycholan-24-Oic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 1, 3, 7, 12-Tetrahydroxycholan-24-Oic acid has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 1, 3, 7, 12-tetrahydroxycholan-24-Oic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
