<strong>Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)</strong> are manufactured chemicals. They are added to the plastics used to make products like computer monitors, televisions, textiles, plastic foams, etc. to make them difficult to burn. PBBs can leave these plastics and find their way into the environment. PBBs are usually colorless to off-white solids. PBBs are mixtures of brominated biphenyl compounds known as congeners.
