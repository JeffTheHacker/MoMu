Ddt and metabolites appears as a colorless crystalline solid or white to off-white powder. Odorless to slightly aromatic. Insoluble in water. Used as an insecticide. DDT is a chlorophenylethane that is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane substituted by additional chloro substituents at positions 4 of the phenyl substituents. It is a commonly used organochlorine insecticide. It has a role as a bridged diphenyl acaricide, a carcinogenic agent, a persistent organic pollutant and an endocrine disruptor. It is an organochlorine insecticide, a benzenoid aromatic compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a chlorophenylethane. It derives from a 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane and a 4,4'-dichlorodiphenylmethane. it is a white, odorless and tasteless, very stable, water-insoluble, synthetic, crystalline chlorinated hydrocarbon that is soluble in most organic solvents, fat and oils and tends to accumulate in ecosystems. DDT was once widely used as a pesticide to control insects in agriculture and to control malaria, typhus and body lice, but its use is now limited. Exposure to DDT mainly affects the nervous system resulting in tremors, dizziness, nausea, incoordination, convulsions and seizures. This substance is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. (NCI05)
