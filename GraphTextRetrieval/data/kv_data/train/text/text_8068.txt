it is an N-arylpiperazine that consists of piperazine carrying two 4-substituted phenyl groups at positions 1 and 4. A triazole antifungal drug. It has a role as a trypanocidal drug. It is a member of triazoles, a N-arylpiperazine, an organofluorine compound, a member of oxolanes, an aromatic ether, a conazole antifungal drug and a triazole antifungal drug. it is a broad-spectrum, second generation, triazole compound with antifungal activity. it strongly inhibits 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme. Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell wall. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis changes the fungal cell membrane composition and integrity, alters membrane permeability and eventually leads to fungal cell lysis. Compared to other azole antifungals, it is a significantly more potent inhibitor of sterol 14-alpha demethylase.
