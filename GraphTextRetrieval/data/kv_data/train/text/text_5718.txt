it, also known as 3, 4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one or 4, 5-dehydrovalerolactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydropyranones. Dihydropyranones are compounds containing a hydrogenated pyran ring which bears a ketone, and contains one double bond. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, 5-hydroxy-4-pentenoic acid D-lactone can be found in nuts. This makes 5-hydroxy-4-pentenoic acid D-lactone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
