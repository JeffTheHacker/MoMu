Calcium phosphide appears as red-brown crystals to gray granular lumps. It reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and phosphine, a flammable poisonous gas. Phosphine will normally ignite spontaneously in contact with air. If there is an excess of water this fire of phosphine will not normally ignite surrounding combustible material.
