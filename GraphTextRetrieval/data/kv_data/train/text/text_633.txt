Bufogenin is a bufadienolide toxin originally isolated from the venom of the Chinese toad Bufo gargarizans; it is also one of the glycosides in the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu, with potential cardiotonic activity. Although the mechanism of action of bufogenin is still under investigation, this agent is a specific Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor and has been shown to reduce blood pressure in a rat model of preeclampsia.
