it is a glucocorticoid that is prednisone in which the oxo group at position 11 has been reduced to the corresponding beta-hydroxy group. It is a drug metabolite of prednisone. It has a role as an adrenergic agent, an anti-inflammatory drug, an antineoplastic agent, an immunosuppressive agent, a drug metabolite, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a glucocorticoid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a Delta(1)-progesterone. it is a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, it enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells populations. (NCI04)
