(S)-it, also known as cicutine or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkaloids and derivatives. These are naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms. This group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly acidic properties. Also some synthetic compounds of similar structure are attributed to alkaloids. In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and more rarely other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus (S)-it exists as a liquid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (S)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (S)-it can be found in black elderberry and pomegranate. This makes (S)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products (S)-it is a potentially toxic compound.
