Cyclobranol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cycloartanols and derivatives. These are steroids containing a cycloartanol moiety. Cyclobranol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Cyclobranol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, cyclobranol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, cyclobranol can be found in cereals and cereal products, papaya, rice, and soy bean. This makes cyclobranol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
