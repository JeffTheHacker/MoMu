it is the maleic acid salt of the (pharmacologically active) (S)-(+)-enantiomer of brompheniramine. A histamine H1 receptor antagonist, it is used for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, including rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist and an anti-allergic agent. It contains a dexbrompheniramine. it is the maleate salt form of dexbrompheniramine, an alkylamine derivative with anticholinergic and sedative properties. Dexbrompheniramine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist that competes with histamine for the H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. The antagonistic action of this agent blocks the activities of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief from the negative histamine-mediated symptoms of allergic reaction such as bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability and spasmodic contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
