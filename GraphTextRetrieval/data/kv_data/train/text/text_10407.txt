it is an aminopyrimidine that consists of 2,6-diaminopyrimidine bearing a bromo substituent at position 5, a 4-cyano-2,6-dimethylphenoxy substituent at position 4 and having a 4-cyanophenyl substituent attached to the 2-amino group. NNRTI of HIV-1, binds directly to RT and blocks RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities It has a role as a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an antiviral agent. It is a dinitrile, an organobromine compound, an aminopyrimidine and an aromatic ether. it is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. it is designed to be active against HIV isolates with mutations that confer resistance to the two most commonly prescribed first-generation NNRTIs. It can bind the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) in multiple conformations, both for native and mutant RT, thereby blocking the enzymatic activity of RT.
