Methionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is butyric acid bearing an amino substituent at position 2 and a methylthio substituent at position 4. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a plant metabolite, a Daphnia magna metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is an alpha-amino acid and a sulfur-containing amino acid. It derives from a butyric acid. It is a conjugate base of a methioninium. It is a conjugate acid of a methioninate. It is a tautomer of a methionine zwitterion. Methionine is one of nine essential amino acids in humans (provided by food), Methionine is required for growth and tissue repair. A sulphur-containing amino acid, methionine improves the tone and pliability of skin, hair, and strengthens nails. Involved in many detoxifying processes, sulphur provided by methionine protects cells from pollutants, slows cell aging, and is essential for absorption and bio-availability of selenium and zinc. Methionine chelates heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, aiding their excretion. It also acts as a lipotropic agent and prevents excess fat buildup in the liver. (NCI04)
