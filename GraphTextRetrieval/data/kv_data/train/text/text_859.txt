it, also known as c12-14-iso-alkanes, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in alcoholic beverages and pulses. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
