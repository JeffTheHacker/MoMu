it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridines and derivatives. Pyridines and derivatives are compounds containing a pyridine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle which consists of one nitrogen atom and five carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
