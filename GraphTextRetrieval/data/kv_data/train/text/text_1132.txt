it, also known as (S)-3-hydroxylauroyl-coa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as (s)-3-hydroxyacyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a (S)-3-hydroxyl acylated coenzyme A derivative it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa) it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the fatty acid elongation in mitochondria pathway, trifunctional protein deficiency, the mitochondrial Beta-oxidation OF medium chain saturated fatty acids pathway, and very-long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (vlcad).
