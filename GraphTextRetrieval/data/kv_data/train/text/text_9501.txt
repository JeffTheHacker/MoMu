it is an orally bioavailable small molecule belonging to the it class of cationic amphiphilic agents with anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, and antiangiogenic properties. it inhibits the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), blocking the signalling pathways of interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and downregulating the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis.
