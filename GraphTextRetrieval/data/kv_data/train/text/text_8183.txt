Glycerol triundecanoate, also known as N-it or 1, 2, 3-triundecanoylglycerol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triacylglycerols. These are glycerides consisting of three fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Glycerol triundecanoate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Glycerol triundecanoate has been found in human adipose tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, glycerol triundecanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and adiposome.
