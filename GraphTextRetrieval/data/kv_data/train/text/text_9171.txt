it is a broad-spectrum oxacephem antibiotic in which the oxazine ring is substituted with a tetrazolylthiomethyl group and the azetidinone ring carries methoxy and 2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido substituents. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is an oxacephem and a cephalosporin. it is a semisynthetic oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic, with antibacterial activity used mainly against gram-negative aerobic bacteria. Replacing the beta-lactam sulfur atom for an oxygen atom and the presence of the methyltetrazolethio moiety and the para-hydroxyphenylmalonyl group, increases the antibacterial activity of it. The 7-alpha-methoxy group and the para-hydroxyphenylmalonyl group increases the stability of this agent against beta-lactamases. The use of this agent has been associated with fatal bleeding events.
