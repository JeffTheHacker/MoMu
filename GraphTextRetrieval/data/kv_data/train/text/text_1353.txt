it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indoles and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing an indole, which is a bicyclic ring system made up of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in brassicas. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
