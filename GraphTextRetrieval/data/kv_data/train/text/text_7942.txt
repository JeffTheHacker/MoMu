it is an optically active form of it having L-configuration. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a micronutrient, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is an aspartate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, an it and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a L-asparaginium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-asparaginate. It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a non-essential amino acid in humans, it is a beta-amido derivative of aspartic acid and plays an important role in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and other proteins. A metabolic precursor to aspartate, it is a nontoxic carrier of residual ammonia to be eliminated from the body. it acts as diuretic. (NCI04)
