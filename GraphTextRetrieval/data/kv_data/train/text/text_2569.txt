it, also known as it or vitamin e-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as vitamin e compounds. These are a group of fat-soluble compounds containing or derived either from a tocopherol or a tocotrienol skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a water-soluble amphipathic formulation of d-alpha-tocopherol succinate coupled, through a succinate linker, to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1000. Due to its amphipathic property in which it forms its own micelles, it is easily taken up into enterocytes, even in the absence of bile salts; fat soluble d-alpha-tocopherol is then released after hydrolysis. This formulation enhances the absorption of d-alpha-tocopherol compared to the administration of free d-alpha-tocopherol. In addition, it may enhance the absorption of water-insoluble agents and other fat-soluble vitamins.
