it is a member of the class of quinolines that is the carboxamide of 4-{3-chloro-4-[(cyclopropylcarbamoyl)amino]phenoxy}-7-methoxyquinoline-6-carboxylic acid. A multi-kinase inhibitor and orphan drug used (as its mesylate salt) for the treatment of various types of thyroid cancer that do not respond to radioiodine. It has a role as a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, an orphan drug, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and a fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonist. It is a member of quinolines, an aromatic ether, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an aromatic amide, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of cyclopropanes and a member of phenylureas. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a synthetic, orally available inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR/FLK-1) tyrosine kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. it blocks VEGFR2 activation by VEGF, resulting in inhibition of the VEGF receptor signal transduction pathway, decreased vascular endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and vascular endothelial cell apoptosis.
