(5beta, 7beta, 10beta)-3, 11-Eudesmadien-2-one belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmane, isoeudesmane or cycloeudesmane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmane skeleton (5beta, 7beta, 10beta)-3, 11-Eudesmadien-2-one exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (5beta, 7beta, 10beta)-3, 11-eudesmadien-2-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (5beta, 7beta, 10beta)-3, 11-eudesmadien-2-one can be found in citrus. This makes (5beta, 7beta, 10beta)-3, 11-eudesmadien-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
