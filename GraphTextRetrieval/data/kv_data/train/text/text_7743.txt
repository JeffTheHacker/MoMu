Isovaleryl-CoA, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Isovaleryl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Isovaleryl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, isovaleryl-CoA is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, isovaleryl-CoA is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. Isovaleryl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, Beta-ketothiolase deficiency, and the isovaleric acidemia pathway.
