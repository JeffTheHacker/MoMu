Cyclosporin A metabolite M18 is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A metabolite M17 in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of residue 1 [(2S,3R,4R,6E)-3,8-dihydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)oct-6-enamide] has undergone addition to the double bond at position 6 to afford the corresponding dioxolane ring. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and a member of oxolanes. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M17.
