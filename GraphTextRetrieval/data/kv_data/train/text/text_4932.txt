it is a member of the class of benzodioxoles that is 1,3-benzodioxole which is substituted at positions 5 by a 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-3-yl group and at positions 4 and 6 by methoxy groups. A very rare type of isoflavonoid-related 1,2-diaryl-2-propenone found in Dysphania glomulifera (red crumbweed) and D. littoralis, the enone moiety is particularly reactive, undergoing ready Michael addition of water and methanol. it has been found to cause extrahepatic biliary atresia (obliteration or discontinuity of the extrahepatic biliary system, resulting in obstruction to bile flow) in a zebrafish model. It has a role as a toxin and a plant metabolite. It is a member of benzodioxoles, an enone, an aromatic ketone, an aromatic ether and a member of phenols.
