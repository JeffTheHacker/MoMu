it is a C-nitro compound that is chlorobenzene carrying a nitro substituent at each of the 2- and 4-positions. It has a role as an epitope, an allergen and a sensitiser. It is a C-nitro compound and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is an aromatic hydrocarbon composed of a benzene ring linked to two nitro groups and one chloride with potential use as an indicator for glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, in the evaluation of T-cell immunocompetence, and as a treatment for warts. The chloride group of dinitrochlorobenzene (it) is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution and is a target for GST-dependent glutathione conjugation in vitro; upon conjugation of the thiol group of glutathione to the it substrate, there is an increase in the absorbance at 340 nm, which permits an indirect quantitation of GST activity in a sample. it induces a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in most patients; therefore, exposure to it can yield an indirect measurement of T-cell activity in a patient and immunocompromised patients may demonstrate decreased hypersensitivity toward it. Following direct application to a wart, it induces an allergic inflammatory response that may cure the viral infection that caused the wart.
