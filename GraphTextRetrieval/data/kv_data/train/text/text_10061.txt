it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as paradols. Paradols are compounds containing a paradol moiety, which is consists of a benzene ring with a decan-3-one moiety, a methoxyl group, and a hydroxyl group at positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in alcoholic beverages, ginger, and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
