it is the organic bromide salt of a 5alpha androstane compound having 3alpha-hydroxy-, 17beta-acetoxy-, 2beta-morpholino- and 16beta-N-allyllyrrolidinium substituents. It has a role as a neuromuscular agent and a muscle relaxant. It is an organic bromide salt and a quaternary ammonium salt. It contains a rocuronium. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-androstane. it is the bromide salt form of rocuronium, an intermediate-acting quaternary aminosteroid with muscle relaxant property. it competitively binds to the nicotinic receptor at the motor end plate, and antagonizes acetylcholine binding, which results in skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis.
