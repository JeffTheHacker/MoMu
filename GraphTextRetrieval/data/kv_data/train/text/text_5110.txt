it, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, matricarin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, matricarin can be found in fats and oils, german camomile, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes matricarin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
