Formyl-CoA, also known as formyl-coenzyme a, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as coenzyme a and derivatives. These are derivative of vitamin B5 containing a 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety attached to a diphospho-adenosine. Formyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). In humans, formyl-CoA is involved in the oxidation OF branched chain fatty acids pathway and the phytanic Acid peroxisomal oxidation pathway. Formyl-CoA is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the refsum disease pathway.
