Aflatoxin Q1 belongs to the class of organic compounds known as difurocoumarocyclopentenones. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a cyclopenten-2-one ring fused to the coumarin moiety of the difurocoumarin skeleton. Aflatoxin Q1 exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, aflatoxin Q1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
