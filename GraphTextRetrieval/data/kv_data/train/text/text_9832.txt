it is a cyclodepsipeptide consisting of a 3,4-dihydroxy-4-methylhexadecanoyl group attached to the amino terminus of the linear heptapeptide Ser-D-Ala-Asp-Asn-Asn-Ser-D-allo-Thr which is cyclised head-to-tail via the 3-hydroxy group on the hexadecanoyl chain. It is an antifungal drug isolated from the barley solid culture of the fungus Glomospora sp. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a peptide antibiotic, a monocarboxylic acid, a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol, a cyclodepsipeptide and a lactam.
