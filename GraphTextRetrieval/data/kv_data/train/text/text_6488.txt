it is a benzoic acid derivative anesthetic agent, with local anesthetic activity. Upon administration, it stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. This inhibits the sodium ion influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses within the neuronal cell, increases the threshold for electrical stimulation and results in a loss of sensation.
