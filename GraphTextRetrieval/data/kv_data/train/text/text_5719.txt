it is a triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine having a phenyl group at position 6 and a chloro substituent at position 8. A short-acting benzodiazepine with general properties similar to diazepam, it is given by mouth as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia. It has a role as an anxiolytic drug, an anticonvulsant and a GABA modulator. It is a member of triazoles and a triazolobenzodiazepine. it is a triazolo-benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. it binds to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor at a site distinct from the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA binding site in the limbic system of the central nervous system (CNS). This binding leads to an opening of the chloride channels, which allows the flow of chloride ions into the neuron, hyperpolarizes the neuronal membrane, inhibits neuronal firing, and leads to a decrease in neuronal excitability.
