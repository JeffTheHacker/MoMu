it is an organic heteropentacyclic compound that is naloxone substituted in which the allyl group attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a cyclopropylmethyl group. A mu-opioid receptor antagonist, it is used to treat alcohol dependence. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a central nervous system depressant, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antidote to opioid poisoning. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a morphinane-like compound and a member of cyclopropanes. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a noroxymorphone derivative with competitive opioid antagonistic property. it reverses the effects of opioid analgesics by binding to the various opioid receptors in the central nervous system, including the mu-, kappa- and gamma-opioid receptors. This leads to an inhibition of the typical actions of opioid analgesics, including analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, miosis, bradycardia, and physical dependence. it is longer-acting and more potent compared to naloxone.
