Ethyl 2, 4-dioxohexanoate, also known as ethyl 2, 4-diketocaproate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-acylpyruvic acids. 3-Acylpyruvic acids are compounds containing a pyruvic acid substituted at the 3-position by an acyl group. Ethyl 2, 4-dioxohexanoate is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, ethyl 2, 4-dioxohexanoate is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
