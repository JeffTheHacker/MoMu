3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, also known as hydroxymethylglutaroyl coenzyme A or HMG-CoA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-hydroxy-3-alkylglutaryl coas. These are alpha, omega dicarboxyacyl-CoA that result from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with one of the carboxy groups of 3-hydroxy-3-alkylglutaric acid. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA has been found in human intestine and endocrine gland tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as blood and urine. Within the cell, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisome. In humans, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA is involved in the pamidronate action pathway, the cerivastatin action pathway, the atorvastatin action pathway, and the desmosterolosis pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include succinyl coa: 3-ketoacid CoA transferase deficiency, the mevalonic aciduria pathway, the maple syrup urine disease pathway, and Beta-ketothiolase deficiency.
