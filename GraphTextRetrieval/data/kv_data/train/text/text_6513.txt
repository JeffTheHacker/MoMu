5,6-epoxyretinoic acid is a retinoid obtained by epoxidation across the 5,6-double bond of retinoic acid. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a human xenobiotic metabolite, a rat metabolite and an EC 4.1.1.17 (ornithine decarboxylase) inhibitor. It is a retinoid and an epoxide. It derives from an all-trans-retinoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 5,6-epoxyretinoate.
