Flutemetamol ((18)F) is a member of the class of benzothiazoles that is 1,3-benzothiazole substituted by 3-((18)F)fluoro-4-(methylamino)phenyl and hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 6 respectively. A positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. It has a role as a radioactive imaging agent. It is a (18)F radiopharmaceutical, a member of benzothiazoles, an aromatic amine and a secondary amino compound. it is a radiopharmaceutical containing flutemetamol, a thioflavin derivative of Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) labeled with the radioisotope fluorine F18 that can be used to detect beta-amyloid deposition upon positron emission tomography (PET). After intravenous administration of flutemetamol F 18, the flutemetamol moiety selectively accumulates in and binds to cerebral fibrillar amyloid-beta in the brain. The fluorine F18 radioisotope moiety is detected using PET, which allows imaging and quantification of amyloid-beta density. Amyloid plaque deposition is linked to cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease, and may be linked to chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI).
