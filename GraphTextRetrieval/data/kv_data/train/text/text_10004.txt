it is (3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid in which the (7E)-hydrogen is substituted by a 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-(methoxymethyl)pyridin-3-yl group. Formerly used (as its sodium salt) to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease, it was withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001 following reports of a severe form of muscle toxicity. It is a member of pyridines, a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a statin (synthetic). It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. it competitively inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses by suppressing major histocompatibility complex II on interferon gamma-stimulated, antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Muscle toxicity (myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) precludes the clinical use of this agent.
