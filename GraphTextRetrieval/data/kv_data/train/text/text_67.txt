it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyranoflavonoids. Pyranoflavonoids are compounds containing a pyran ring fused to a 2-phenyl-1, 4-benzopyran skeleton. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
