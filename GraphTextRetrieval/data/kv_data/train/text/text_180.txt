it, also known as sinequan or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dibenzoxepines. Dibenzoxepines are compounds containing a dibenzoxepine moiety, which consists of two benzene connected by an oxazepine ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, doxepin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be converted into (e)-2-hydroxydoxepin through its interaction with the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6. In addition, it can be converted into N-desmethyldoxepin and formaldehyde; which is mediated by the enzymes cytochrome P450 1A2, cytochrome P450 3A4, cytochrome P450 2C19, and cytochrome P450 2C9. In humans, doxepin is involved in the doxepin H1-antihistamine action pathway and the doxepin metabolism pathway. it is a potentially toxic compound. it is a dibenzoxepin derivative and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with antipruritic, antidepressive and anxiolytic activities. it blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) into presynaptic terminals thereby prolonging the availability of the monoaminergic neurotransmitters within the synaptic cleft and enhancing their neurotransmission. it also has antagonistic effects on histamine H1, 5-HT2, alpha-1 adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. The antipruritic effect of this agent is mediated through inhibition of histamine receptors.
