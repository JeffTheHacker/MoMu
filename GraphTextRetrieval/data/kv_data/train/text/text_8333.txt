it is an N-acetyl-L-amino acid that is the N-acetylated derivative of the natural amino acid L-cysteine. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an antioxidant, an antiviral drug, an antidote to paracetamol poisoning, a vulnerary, a mucolytic, a human metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a L-cysteine derivative, an it and a N-acetyl-L-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-acetyl-L-cysteinate. it is a synthetic N-acetyl derivative of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, a precursor of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione. it regenerates liver stores of glutathione. This agent also reduces disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus. Some evidence suggests that it may exert an anti-apoptotic effect due to its antioxidant activity, possibly preventing cancer cell development or growth. In addition, it has inhibited viral stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates, thereby producing antiviral activity in HIV patients. (NCI04)
