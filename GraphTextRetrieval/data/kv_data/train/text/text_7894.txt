it is an organochlorine compound that is methylene chloride in which both hydrogens are replaced by phosphonic acid groups. It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification, and is used (often as the disodium salt tetrahydrate) as an adjunct in the treatment of severe hypercalcaemia associated with malignancy, and in the management of osteolytic lesions and bone pain associated with skeletal metastases. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organochlorine compound, a one-carbon compound and a 1,1-bis(phosphonic acid). It is a conjugate acid of a clondronate(2-). it is a first-generation bisphosphonate with anti-resorptive and anti-hypercalcemic activities. it adsorbs onto the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystals in bone matrix. Although the exact mechanism through which it exerts its cytotoxic effect on osteoclasts has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent is metabolized intracellularly to a toxic beta-gamma-methylene analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), AppCCl2p. The ATP analog AppCCl2p competitively inhibits ADP/ATP translocase, thereby interfering with mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular energy metabolism. This may cause osteoclast apoptosis and, eventually, inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
