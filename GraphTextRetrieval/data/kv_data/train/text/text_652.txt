it is a butenolide that is furan-2(5H)-one substituted by a phenyl group at position 3 and by a p-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl group at position 4. A selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, it was used from 1999 to 2004 for the treatment of ostoarthritis, but was withdrawn following concerns about an associated increased risk of heart attack and stroke. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an analgesic. It is a sulfone and a butenolide. it is a synthetic, nonsteroidal derivative of phenyl-furanone with antiinflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties and potential antineoplastic properties. it binds to and inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in an inhibition of the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-related metabolic pathways may represent key regulators of cell proliferation and neo-angiogenesis. Some epithelial tumor cell types overexpress pro-angiogenic COX-2. (NCI04)
