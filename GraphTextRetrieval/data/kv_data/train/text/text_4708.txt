Maltotriose, also known as glycan or polyglycose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. Maltotriose is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, maltotriose is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Maltotriose exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, maltotriose can be found in root vegetables. This makes maltotriose a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
