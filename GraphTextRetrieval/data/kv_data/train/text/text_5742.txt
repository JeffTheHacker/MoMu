it is a member of the class of 1,3-thiazoles having a dimethylaminomethyl substituent at position 2 and an alkylthiomethyl moiety at position 4. It has a role as an anti-ulcer drug, a H2-receptor antagonist and a cholinergic drug. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a C-nitro compound, an organic sulfide, a tertiary amino compound and a carboxamidine. it is a competitive and reversible histamine H2-receptor antagonist with antacid activity. it inhibits the histamine H2-receptors located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, thereby reducing basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, resulting in a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli.
