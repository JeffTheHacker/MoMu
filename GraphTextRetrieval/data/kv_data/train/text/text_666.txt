Gamma-Nonanolide, also known as G-nonanolide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. Thus, Gamma-nonanolide is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. Gamma-Nonanolide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Gamma-Nonanolide has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, Gamma-nonanolide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Gamma-Nonanolide exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
