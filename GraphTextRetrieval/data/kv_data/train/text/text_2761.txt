A synthetic estrogen that has been used as a hormonal antineoplastic agent. it is a synthetic hydrogenated derivative of diethylstilbestrol (DES). it exhibits strong affinity for estrogen receptors that are overexpressed in some types of cancers. When conjugated with a neoplastic drug, hexestrol may selectively concentrate the cytotoxic agent in estrogen receptor-rich tumors. This agent may also be mutagenic. (NCI04)
