it is an aminobenzoic acid that is anthranilic acid in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a 2,3-dimethylphenyl group. Although classed as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, its anti-inflammatory properties are considered to be minor. It is used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including headaches, dental pain, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as an analgesic, an antirheumatic drug, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an antipyretic, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is an aminobenzoic acid and a secondary amino compound. it is an anthranilic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. it inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in a decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, by prostaglandin synthase, is responsible for the therapeutic effects of it. it also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
