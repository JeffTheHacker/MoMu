it (anhydrous) is a chloride salt in which the negative charge of the chloride ions is balanced by succinylcholine dications. It has a role as a muscle relaxant. It contains a succinylcholine. it is the chloride salt form of succinylcholine, a quaternary ammonium compound and depolarizing agent with short-term muscle relaxant properties. it binds to nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction and opening the ligand-gated channels in the same way as acetylcholine, resulting in depolarization and inhibition of neuromuscular transmission. Depolarization may be prolonged due to succinylcholine's resistance to acetylcholinesterases thereby leading to disorganized muscle contraction followed by skeletal muscle relaxation and flaccid paralysis.
