Isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid c-glycosides. Flavonoid C-glycosides are compounds containing a carbohydrate moiety which is C-glycosidically linked to the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid backbone. Isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside can be found in cucumber, muskmelon, and tea. This makes isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
