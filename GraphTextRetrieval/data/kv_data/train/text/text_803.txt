it is a phenothiazine derivative in which the phenothiazine tricycle carries a chloro substituent at the 2-position and a 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]propyl group at N-10. It has a role as a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, a dopaminergic antagonist and an antiemetic. It is a member of phenothiazines, a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine and an organochlorine compound. It derives from a hydride of a 10H-phenothiazine. it is a phenothiazine derivative and a dopamine antagonist with antiemetic and antipsychotic properties. it blocks postsynaptic dopamine 2(D2) receptors in the mesolimbic and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), thereby preventing the excess of dopamine in the brain. This leads to reduction in psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. it appears to exert its antiemetic activity by blocking the dopamine and histamine-1 receptor in the CTZ thereby relieving nausea and vomiting in the brain. In addition, it binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors.
