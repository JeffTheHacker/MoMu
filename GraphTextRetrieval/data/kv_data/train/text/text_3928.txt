it is a quinazolinone sulphonamide-based diuretic, structurally related to metolazone, with thiazide-like activity. As a thiazide-like diuretic, it acts by blocking reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule and the ascending branch of the loop of Henle. This causes an increase in diuresis with the elimination of chloride and sodium.
