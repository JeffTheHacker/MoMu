4-Butyl-2, 5-dimethylthiazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. 4-Butyl-2, 5-dimethylthiazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-butyl-2, 5-dimethylthiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 4-butyl-2, 5-dimethylthiazole can be found in nuts and potato. This makes 4-butyl-2, 5-dimethylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
