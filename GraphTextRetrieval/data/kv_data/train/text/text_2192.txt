Methomyl is a white crystalline solid with slight sulfurous smell. Used as a nematocide, and an insecticide on vegetables, tobacco, cotton, alfalfa, soy beans, and corn. (EPA, 1998) Methomyl is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of methylcarbamic acid with the hydroxy group of 1-(methylsulfanyl)acetaldoxime. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide, a nematicide, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, an insecticide and an agrochemical. It is a carbamate ester and an aliphatic sulfide. It derives from a methylcarbamic acid and a 1-(methylsulfanyl)acetaldoxime.
