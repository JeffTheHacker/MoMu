MG(0:0/20:0/0:0), also known as mag(0:0/20:0) or 1-monoacylglyceride, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as endocannabinoids. These are arachidonic acid derivatives containing either an N-acetylethanolamine(type 1) or a glycerol(types 2 and 3) moiety attached to the aliphatic tail. MG(0:0/20:0/0:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. MG(0:0/20:0/0:0) has been found throughout all human tissues. Within the cell, MG(0:0/20:0/0:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
