it (as ulobetasol propionate)  is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. It is used for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. it is a synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictor activities. it, a topical steroid, diffuses across cell membranes to interact with cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors located in both the dermal and intradermal cells, thereby activating gene expression of anti-inflammatory proteins mediated via the corticosteroid receptor response element. Specifically, this agent induces phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, which inhibit the release of arachidonic acid, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. As a result, it reduces edema, erythema, and pruritus through its cutaneous effects on vascular dilation and permeability.
