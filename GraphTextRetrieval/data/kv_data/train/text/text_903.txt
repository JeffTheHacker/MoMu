it is a pyrimidinecarboxamide that is nicotinamide in which one of the hydrogens attached to the carboxamide nitrogen is replaced by a 2-(nitrooxy)ethyl group. It has both nitrate-like and ATP-sensitive potassium channel activator properties, and is used for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris. It has a role as a vasodilator agent and a potassium channel opener. It is a pyridinecarboxamide and a nitrate ester. It derives from a nicotinamide. it is a niacinamide derivative, a plasma membrane adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K+) (KATP) channel activator and a nitric oxide (NO) donor, with vasodilatory, antihypertensive and potential cardio- and lung-protective activities. Upon administration, it binds to and opens KATP channels, which causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, stimulates vasodilatation, reduces vasoresistance, decreases blood pressure and protects the myocardium against ischemia. In addition, it exerts nitrate-like properties, through the stimulation of guanylate cyclase, the downregulation of Rho-kinase activity and the further promotion of venous vasodilation. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it may exhibit protective activity against radiation-induced lung and heart toxicity, possibly by preventing both accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-induced cellular damage.
