1-Epi-alpha-gurjunene, also known as 4-aromadendrene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 5, 10-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids. These are aromadendrane sesquiterpenoids that arise from the C5-C10 cyclization of the aromadendrane skeleton. 1-Epi-alpha-gurjunene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1-epi-alpha-gurjunene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
