Vincristine appears as a white crystalline solid. Melting point 218Â°C. Used as an antineoplastic. Vincristine is a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. Vincristine binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.
