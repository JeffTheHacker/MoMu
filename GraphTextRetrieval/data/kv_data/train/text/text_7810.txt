it is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is irigenin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxyisoflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones and a 7-hydroxyisoflavones 7-O-beta-D-glucoside. It derives from an irigenin.
