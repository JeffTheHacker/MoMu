Cubebin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dibenzylbutyrolactols. These are lignan compounds containing a 3, 4-dibenzyloxolan-2-ol moiety. Cubebin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, cubebin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, cubebin can be found in herbs and spices and pepper (spice). This makes cubebin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
