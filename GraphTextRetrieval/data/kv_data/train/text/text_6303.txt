N, N-Diethylbenzeneacetamide, also known as N, N-diethylphenylacetamide or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylacetamides. These are amide derivatives of phenylacetic acids. N, N-Diethylbenzeneacetamide exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, N, N-diethylbenzeneacetamide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, N, N-diethylbenzeneacetamide can be found in green vegetables. This makes N, N-diethylbenzeneacetamide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
