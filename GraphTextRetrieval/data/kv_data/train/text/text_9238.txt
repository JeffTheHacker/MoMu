it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmane, isoeudesmane or cycloeudesmane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmane skeleton. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 10-epijunenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 10-epijunenol can be found in alcoholic beverages and fruits. This makes 10-epijunenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
