it is a carbamate ester that is cytidine in which the hydrogen at position 5 is replaced by fluorine and in which the amino group attached to position 4 is converted into its N-(penyloxy)carbonyl derivative. it is a antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of cancers. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a prodrug and an antimetabolite. It is a carbamate ester, an organofluorine compound and a member of cytidines. it is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to the class of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites. As a prodrug, it is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells. FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand.
