it is the disodium salt of cefotetan. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It contains a cefotetan(2-). Cefotetan Disodium is the disodium salt form of cefotetan and a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum, beta-lactamase-resistant, second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it causes inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis by inactivating penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) thereby interfering with the final transpeptidation step required for cross-linking of peptidoglycan units which are a component of the cell wall. This results in a reduction of cell wall stability and causes cell lysis.
