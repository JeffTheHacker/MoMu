it is the R-enantiomer of serine. It has a role as a NMDA receptor agonist, a human metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a D-alpha-amino acid and a serine. It is a conjugate base of a D-serinium. It is a conjugate acid of a D-serinate. It is an enantiomer of a L-serine. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a non-essential amino acid and dextro isomer of serine with antipsychotic activity. it is a selective full agonist at the glycine site of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor. Hypofunction of NMDA type of neurotransmission is believed to play a major role in pathophysiology of schizophrenia, therefore, administration of it and subsequent activation of NMDA receptors may alleviate psychotic tendencies.
