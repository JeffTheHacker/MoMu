Butyl 2-methyl propanoate, also known as it or fema 2188, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carboxylic acid esters. These are carboxylic acid derivatives in which the carbon atom from the carbonyl group is attached to an alkyl or an aryl moiety through an oxygen atom (forming an ester group). Butyl 2-methyl propanoate exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Butyl 2-methyl propanoate exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Butyl 2-methyl propanoate is a sweet, apple, and banana tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, fruits, milk and milk products, and pomes. This makes butyl 2-methyl propanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
