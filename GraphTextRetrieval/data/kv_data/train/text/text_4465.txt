it is a hydrazone obtained by formal condensation of the two carbonyl groups of methylglyoxal with the primary amino groups of two molecules of aminoguanidine. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and an EC 4.1.1.50 (adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) inhibitor. It is a hydrazone and a member of guanidines. It derives from a methylglyoxal and an aminoguanidine. It is a conjugate base of a mitoguazone(2+). it is a guanylhydrazone with potential antineoplastic activity. it competitively inhibits S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (SAMD), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of polyamines, resulting in decreased proliferation of tumor cells, antimitochondrial effects, and p53-independent apoptosis. Polyamines, specifically spermine and spermidine, are essential for thymidine kinase production, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. (NCI04)
