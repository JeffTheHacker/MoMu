Methyl 2-methylpropyl 2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate is a dihydropyridine that is 1,4-dihydropyridine which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, a methoxycarbonyl group at position 3, an o-nitrophenyl group at position 4, and an isobutoxycarbonyl group at position 5. The racemate, a calcium channel blocker, is used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. It is a C-nitro compound, a diester, a dihydropyridine, a methyl ester and a member of dicarboxylic acids and O-substituted derivatives. it is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent. it inhibits the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, causing dilatation of the main coronary and systemic arteries and decreasing myocardial contractility. This agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein which is overexpressed in some multi-drug resistant tumors and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents. (NCI04)
