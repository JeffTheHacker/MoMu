Isoit, also known as fema 2163, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. Isoit is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, isoit is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Isoit has a camphor, fruit, and lavender taste. Isoit is a potentially toxic compound.
