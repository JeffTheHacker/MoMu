2, 6-Dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone, also known as 2, 6-dimethoxyquinone or 2, 6-dimethoxysemiquinone radicals, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as p-benzoquinones. These are benzoquinones where the two C=O groups are attached at the 1- and 4-positions, respectively. 2, 6-Dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 6-dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 6-dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone can be found in common wheat and green vegetables. This makes 2, 6-dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
