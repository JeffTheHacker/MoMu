A tripeptide that stimulates the release of THYROTROPIN and PROLACTIN. It is synthesized by the neurons in the PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS of the HYPOTHALAMUS. After being released into the pituitary portal circulation, it (was called TRF) stimulates the release of TSH and PRL from the ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND.
