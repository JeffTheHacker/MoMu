it is a benzimidazole substituted with a carbamoyl group at C-4 and a (2R)-2-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl moiety at C-2. It is a potent, orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 2.4.2.30 (NAD(+) ADP-ribosyltransferase) inhibitor. it is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1 and -2 inhibitor with chemosensitizing and antitumor activities. With no antiproliferative effects as a single agent at therapeutic concentrations, ABT-888 inhibits PARPs, thereby inhibiting DNA repair and potentiating the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents. PARP nuclear enzymes are activated by DNA single or double strand breaks, resulting in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of other nuclear DNA binding proteins involved in DNA repair; poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to efficient DNA repair and to survival of proliferating cells exposed to mild genotoxic stresses as induced by as oxidants, alkylating agents or ionizing radiation.
