it appears as a colorless liquid. Denser than water. Flash point 170Â°F. Boiling point 195Â°F. Toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Used as a pesticide and fumigant. Dibromochloropropane is a dark amber to dark brown colored, halogenated liquid with a pungent odor. Dibromochloropropane is a formerly known pesticide that was used as a soil fumigant and nematocide on crops, and is currently only used as an intermediate in organic synthesis and as a research chemical. Inhalation exposure to this substance results in central nervous system depression and pulmonary edema, while oral exposure causes gastrointestinal distress. Dibromochloropropane is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. (NCI05)
