Tirofiban Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of tirofiban, a non-peptide tyrosine derivative with anticoagulant property. Tirofiban antagonizes fibrinogen binding to the platelet cell surface receptor, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIA complex, one of the two purinergic receptors activated by ADP. The antagonism prevents adenylyl cyclase activation, which mediated via GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex, and results in decreased levels of cAMP and thereby interferes with platelet membrane function and subsequent platelet-platelet interaction, release of platelet granule constituents and prolongation of bleeding time.
