it is a hydrated form of anhydrous magnesium acetate salt with the chemical formula of Mg(CH3COO)2 â¢ 4H2O. As a salt form of magnesium, magnesium acetate is one of the bioavailable forms of magnesium and forms a very water soluble compound. Magnesium is an essential element and second most abundant cation in the body that plays a key role in maintaining normal cellular function such as production of ATP and efficient enzyme activity. it can be used as an electrolyte supplementation or a reagent in molecular biology experiments. it is the hydrated acetate salt form of magnesium. Magnesium is a divalent cation essential for a number of biochemical processes involved in nerve signaling, bone mineralization and muscle contractions. About 350 enzymes involved in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, formation of cyclic-AMP and ATP, cellular signal transduction and protein and nucleic acid synthesis are dependent on magnesium.
