it (it) is a synthetic peptidomimetic drug consisting of ten amino acids, and acts as an effective and specific antagonist of bradykinin B2 receptors. It has been approved in the EU for use in hereditary angioedema, and is under investigation for a number of other conditions in which bradykinin is thought to play a significant role. it currently has orphan drug status in the United States and FDA approved on August 25, 2011. it is an antagonist of the human bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R), that can be used for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). Upon administration, icatibant targets and binds to B2R, thereby preventing bradykinin from binding to the B2R. This may prevent bradykinin/B2R-mediated vasodilation, the resulting increase in vascular permeability, and the swelling, inflammation, and pain associated with HAE. This may also prevent or improve pulmonary edema not associated with HAE and improve the associated decrease in blood oxygen levels.
