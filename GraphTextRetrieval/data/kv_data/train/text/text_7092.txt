it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as physalins and derivatives. These are steroidal constituents of Physalis plants which possess an unusual 13, 14-seco-16, 24-cyclo-steroidal ring skeleton (where the bond that is normally present between the 13 and 14 positions in other steroids is broken while a new bond between positions 16 and 24 is formed). it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, physalin D is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, physalin D can be found in fruits and herbs and spices. This makes physalin D a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
