it is a penicillin and a 1,5-naphthyridine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is a naphthydridine derivative of the broad spectrum, semisynthetic ampicillin with antibacterial activity. it specifically binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, thereby preventing the cross-linkage of peptidoglycans, which are critical components of the bacterial cell wall. This leads to a weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing bacterial cell lysis.
