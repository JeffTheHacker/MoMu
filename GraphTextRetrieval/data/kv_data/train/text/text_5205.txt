3beta-Cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cucurbitacins. These are polycyclic compounds containing the tetracyclic cucurbitane nucleus skeleton, 19-(10->9b)-abeo-10alanost-5-ene (also known as 9b-methyl-19-nor lanosta-5-ene), with a variety of oxygenation functionalities at different positions. 3beta-Cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 3beta-Cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3beta-cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3beta-cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol can be found in bitter gourd and green vegetables. This makes 3beta-cucurbita-5, 24-dien-3-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
