it is a secondary carboxamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-(N,N-dimethylcarbamimidoyl)benzoic acid with the amino group of 2-amino-N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-5-methoxybenzamide. A synthetic anticoagulant compound that targets activated factor Xa in the coagulation cascade. It has a role as an anticoagulant and an EC 3.4.21.6 (coagulation factor Xa) inhibitor. It is a member of guanidines, a member of benzamides, a secondary carboxamide, a monochloropyridine and a monomethoxybenzene. it is an orally active inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa (activated factor X) with anticoagulant activity. it is primarily excreted unchanged in the bile and has a half life of about 19 hours.
