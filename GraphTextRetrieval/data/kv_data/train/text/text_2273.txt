it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-butyl-5-ethyl-4-methyloxazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2-butyl-5-ethyl-4-methyloxazole can be found in cocoa and cocoa products. This makes 2-butyl-5-ethyl-4-methyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
