Dihydronootkatone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Dihydronootkatone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, dihydronootkatone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Dihydronootkatone has a citrus, fruit, and grapefruit taste.
