it is a member of the class of pyrazoles that is ethene in which the hydrogens at position 1 have been replaced by p-tert-butylphenyl and cyano groups, while the hydrogens at position 2 have been replaced by pivaloyloxy and 1,3,4-trimethylpyrazol-5-yl groups (the E isomer). A proacaricide (by hydrolysis of the pivalate ester linkage to give the corresponding enol), it was formerly used for the control of mites in fruit, vegetables and tea. It has a role as a proacaricide and an agrochemical. It is a nitrile, a pivalate ester and a member of pyrazoles.
