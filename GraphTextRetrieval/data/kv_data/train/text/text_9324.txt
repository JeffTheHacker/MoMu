it is a dicarboxylic acid monoester that is ethyl 4-phenylbutanoate in which a hydrogen alpha to the carboxy group is substituted by the amino group of L-alanyl-L-proline (S-configuration). It has a role as a prodrug, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a dipeptide. It derives from an itt (anhydrous). it is a dicarbocyl-containing peptide and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, it is converted by de-esterification into its active form itt. itt competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
