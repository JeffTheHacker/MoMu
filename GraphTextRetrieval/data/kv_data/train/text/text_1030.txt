Chymopapain, also known as tiron or bax 1526, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzenesulfonic acids and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing a sulfonic acid or a derivative thereof that is linked to a benzene ring. Chymopapain is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, chymopapain is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, chymopapain can be found in fruits and papaya. This makes chymopapain a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
