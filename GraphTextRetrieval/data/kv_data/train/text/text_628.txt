it is a tertiary alcohol that is methanol in which the hydrogens attached to the carbon are replaced by cyclopropyl, p-methoxyphenyl and pyrimidin-5-yl groups. By inhibiting gibberellin biosynthesis, it reduces plant growth, resulting in reduced internode elongation and thus more compact plants. It is used in the commercial production of a wide variety of container-grown bedding and foliage plants, including chrysanthemums, Easter lilies and poinsettias. It has a role as a plant growth retardant, a cellulose synthesis inhibitor and a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a tertiary alcohol and a member of pyrimidines.
