it is a drug used in nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging. The radioisotope, technetium-99m, is chelated by two 1,2-bis[di-(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino]ethane ligands which belong to the group of diphosphines and which are referred to as tetrofosmin. It is a lipophilic technetium phosphine dioxo cation that was formulated into a freeze-dried kit which yields an injection. it was developed by GE Healthcare and FDA approved on February 9, 1996. Technetium it is a radiopharmaceutical consisting of tetrofosmin, composed of two bidentate diphosphine ligands chelating the metastable radioisotope technetium Tc-99 (99mTc), with potential imaging activity upon SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). Upon administration, it is preferentially taken up by, and accumulates in, myocardial cells. Upon imaging, myocardial cells can be visualized and changes in ischemia and/or perfusion can be detected.
