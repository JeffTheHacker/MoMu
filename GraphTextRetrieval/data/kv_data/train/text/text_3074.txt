it is a member of the class of quinazolines that is quinazoline substituted by an amino group at position 4, methoxy groups at positions 6 and 7 and a piperazin-1-yl group at position 2 which in turn is substituted by a 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-ylcarbonyl group at position 4. An antihypertensive agent, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, an antineoplastic agent, a vasodilator agent and an antihyperplasia drug. It is a member of quinazolines, a N-acylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a benzodioxine, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an aromatic amine. it is a quinazoline with antihypertensive and antineoplastic properties. it is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that selectively inhibits alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Blockages of the alpha-1 adrenergic action on the vascular smooth muscles lead to a decrease in vascular resistance and antihypertensive activity. This agent also shows high affinity to alpha-1c adrenoceptor, the predominant functional type in the prostate, which may partially attribute to its effect in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, it induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells mediated through inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt-signaling death receptor regulatory pathway.
