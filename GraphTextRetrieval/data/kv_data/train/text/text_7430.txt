Diethyldisulfide, also known as 1, 1'-dithiodiethane or 3, 4-dithiahexane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkyldisulfides. These are organic compounds containing a disulfide group R-SS-R' where R and R' are both alkyl groups. Diethyldisulfide exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, diethyldisulfide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Diethyldisulfide exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Diethyldisulfide is a garlic, gassy, and greasy tasting compound that can be found in fruits. This makes diethyldisulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
