it, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glycosphingolipids. These are sphingolipids containing a saccharide moiety glycosidically attached to the sphingoid base. Although saccharide moieties are mostly O-glycosidically linked to the ceramide moiety, other sphingolipids with glycosidic bonds of other types (e. g. S-, C-, or N-type) has been reported. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human brain tissue. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and endosome.
