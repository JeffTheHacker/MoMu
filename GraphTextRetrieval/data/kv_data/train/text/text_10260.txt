it is an oxazinoquinolone carrying carboxy, fluoro, methyl and 4-methylpiperazino substituents. A synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, it inhibits the supercoiling activity of bacterial DNA gyrase, halting DNA replication. It has a role as a DNA synthesis inhibitor, an antiinfective agent and an antibacterial drug. It is an oxazinoquinoline, a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a 3-oxo monocarboxylic acid, an organic heterotricyclic compound, a quinolone antibiotic and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. it is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial antibiotic. it binds to and inhibits bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair, resulting in cell death in sensitive bacterial species.
