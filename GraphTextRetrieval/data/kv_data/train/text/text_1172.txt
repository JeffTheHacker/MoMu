it is a quinoline compound having a cyano group at the 3-position, a 3-chloro-4-(2-pyridylmethoxy)anilino group at the 4-position, a 4-dimethylamino-trans-but-2-enoylamido group at the 6-position, and an ethoxy group at the 7-position. It has a role as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of quinolines and a nitrile. it is an orally available, 6,7-disubstituted-4-anilinoquinoline-3-carbonitrile irreversible inhibitor of the HER-2 receptor tyrosine kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to the HER-2 receptor irreversibly, thereby reducing autophosphorylation in cells, apparently by targeting a cysteine residue in the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor. Treatment of cells with this agent results in inhibition of downstream signal transduction events and cell cycle regulatory pathways; arrest at the G1-S (Gap 1/DNA synthesis)-phase transition of the cell division cycle; and ultimately decreased cellular proliferation. it also inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and the proliferation of EGFR-dependent cells.
