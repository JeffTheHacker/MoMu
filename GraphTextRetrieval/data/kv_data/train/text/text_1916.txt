Cyanocob(III)alamin is a complex cob(III)alamin in which cobalt is positioned in the centre of a planar corrin tetrapyrrole ring and bound axially to a 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety and a cyano group. It is one of several forms of the vitamin known as vitamin B12. It has a role as a vitamin. It is an alkylcob(III)alamin and a member of cob(III)alamins. Cyanocobalamin is a cobalt-containing coordination compound generated by intestinal microbes, and a natural water-soluble vitamin of the B-complex family that must combine with Intrinsic Factor for absorption by the intestine. Cyanocobalamin is necessary for hematopoiesis, neural metabolism, DNA and RNA production, and carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. B12 improves iron functions in the metabolic cycle and assists folic acid in choline synthesis. B12 metabolism is interconnected with that of folic acid. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes pernicious anemia, megaloblastic anemia, and neurologic lesions.
