it is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which residue 1 [(2S,3R,4R,6E)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)oct-6-enoic acid] has undergone allylic oxidation to give the corresponding primary allylic alcohol, and in which residue 9 (N-methylleucine) has undergone oxidation so as to introduce a hydroxy group at the carbon bearing the two methyl groups. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative, a tertiary alcohol and a primary allylic alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M1 and a cyclosporin A metabolite M17.
