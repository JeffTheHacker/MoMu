Gadodiamide is a Paramagnetic Contrast Agent. The mechanism of action of gadodiamide is as a Magnetic Resonance Contrast Activity. Gadodiamide is a paramagnetic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), with imaging activity upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When placed in a magnetic field, gadodiamide generates a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rate of nearby protons. This change in proton relaxation dynamics, iincreases the MRI signal intensity of tissues in which gadodiamide has accumulated; therefore, visualization of those tissues is enhanced.
