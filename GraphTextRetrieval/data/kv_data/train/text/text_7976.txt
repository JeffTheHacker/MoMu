it is a tripeptide compound consisting of glutamic acid attached via its side chain to the N-terminus of cysteinylglycine. It has a role as a skin lightening agent, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite, an antioxidant and a cofactor. It is a tripeptide, a thiol and a L-cysteine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of a itate(1-). it is a tripeptide comprised of three amino acids (cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine) present in most mammalian tissue. it acts as an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger and a detoxifying agent. it is also important as a cofactor for the enzyme it peroxidase, in the uptake of amino acids, and in the synthesis of leukotrienes. As a substrate for it S-transferase, this agent reacts with a number of harmful chemical species, such as halides, epoxides and free radicals, to form harmless inactive products. In erythrocytes, these reactions prevent oxidative damage through the reduction of methemoglobin and peroxides. it is also involved in the formation and maintenance of disulfide bonds in proteins and in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes.
