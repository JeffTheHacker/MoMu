it is a sulfone metabolite of sulindac that inhibits cell growth by inducing apoptosis independently of cyclooxygenase inhibition. It inhibits the development and induces regression of premalignant adenomatous polyps. Lipoxygenase and Cox-2 inhibitor. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a sulfone, a monocarboxylic acid and an organofluorine compound. It derives from a sulindac. it is an inactive metabolite of the nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory agent sulindac. After oral administration, sulindac undergoes extensive biotransformation including irreversible oxidation to it. Approximately, one half of an administered dose of sulindac is eliminated through the urine, mostly as the conjugated sulfone metabolite. (NCI04)
