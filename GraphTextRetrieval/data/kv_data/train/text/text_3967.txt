it is a member of the class of imidazolidines that is imidapril in which the ethyl ester group has been hydrolysed to the corresponding acid group. It is the active metabolite of imidapril used to treat hypertension. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor, an antihypertensive agent and a drug metabolite. It is a dipeptide, a member of imidazolidines, a secondary amino compound, a dicarboxylic acid and a N-acylurea. It derives from an imidapril. it is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
