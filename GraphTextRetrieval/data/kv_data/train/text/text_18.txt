Pangamic acid, also known as vitamin B15 or pangamate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acid esters. These are ester derivatives of alpha amino acids. Pangamic acid is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, pangamic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, pangamic acid can be found in apricot, cereals and cereal products, fruits, and rice. This makes pangamic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
