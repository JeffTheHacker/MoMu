it is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor with antidepressant activity. it selectively inhibits MAO type B, an enzyme catalyzing the oxidative deamination and inactivation of certain catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine, within the presynaptic nerve terminals. By inhibiting the metabolism of these biogenic amines in the brain, it increases their concentration and binding to postsynaptic receptors. Increased receptor stimulation may cause downregulation of central receptors which may attribute to it's antidepressant effect.
