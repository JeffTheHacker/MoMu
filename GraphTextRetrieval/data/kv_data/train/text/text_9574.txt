it, also known as N-isobutyl-acetamide or acetylisobutylamine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetamides. These are organic compounds with the general formula RNHC(=O)CH3, where R= organyl group. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, N-(2-methylpropyl)acetamide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, N-(2-methylpropyl)acetamide can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes N-(2-methylpropyl)acetamide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
