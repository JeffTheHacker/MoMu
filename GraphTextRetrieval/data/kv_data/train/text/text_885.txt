3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA, also known as 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-oxo-acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a 3-oxo acylated coenzyme A derivative. 3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3-oxooctanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, 3-oxooctanoyl-CoA is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway. 3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (scad deficiency), trifunctional protein deficiency, the fatty acid elongation in mitochondria pathway, and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (mcad).
