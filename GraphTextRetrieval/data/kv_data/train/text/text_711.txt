it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Cancer, Metastases, Breast Cancer, Breast Neoplasms, and Pancreatic Neoplasms, among others. it is a semi-synthetic derivative of the taxane 10-deacetylbaccatin III with potential antineoplastic activities. it binds to tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and stabilization and preventing microtubule depolymerization, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. it penetrates the blood brain barrier.
