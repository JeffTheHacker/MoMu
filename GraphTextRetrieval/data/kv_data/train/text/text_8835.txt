it is loratadine in which the ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the piperidine ring is replaced by hydrogen. The major metabolite of loratidine, it is an antihistamine which is used for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions including rhinitis and chronic urticaria. It does not readily enter the central nervous system, so does not cause drowsiness. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an anti-allergic agent and a cholinergic antagonist. it is a long-acting piperidine derivate with selective H1 antihistaminergic and non-sedating properties. it diminishes the typical histaminergic effects on H1-receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, capillaries and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, including vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, pain, itching and spasmodic contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. it is used to provide symptomatic relieve of allergic symptoms.
