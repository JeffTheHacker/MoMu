2', 6'-Dihydroxyacetophenone, also known as 1-(2, 6-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethanone or 2-acetyl-resorcinol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. 2', 6'-Dihydroxyacetophenone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2', 6'-dihydroxyacetophenone is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
