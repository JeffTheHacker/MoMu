it appears as odorless yellow powder or crystalline solid. Melting point 316Â°C. Almost tasteless at first and with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Acidified solutions give a blue fluorescence. Used as a diuretic drug. it is pteridine substituted at positions 2, 4 and 7 with amino groups and at position 6 with a phenyl group. A sodium channel blocker, it is used as a diuretic in the treatment of hypertension and oedema. It has a role as a diuretic and a sodium channel blocker. it is a pteridine derivative with potassium-sparing diuretic property. it blocks the sodium-potassium exchange pump (Na-K-ATPase) in the luminal membrane of principal cells in the late distal tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct in the kidney. This reversible inhibition of the electrogenic sodium transport decreases the lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference and thus reduces the driving force for K+ movement into the tubular lumen resulting in the inhibition of sodium reabsorption in exchange for K+ and H+.
