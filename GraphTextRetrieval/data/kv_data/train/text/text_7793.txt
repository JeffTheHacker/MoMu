it appears as a white crystalline solid. Forms explosive mixtures wilh certain combustible materials. Difficult to burn, but will accelerate burning of combustible materials. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in an explosion. Used in explosives, pyrotechnics, photography. it is the potassium salt of perchloric acid and a member of the Hofmeister ions series with thyroid blocking properties. it is a competitive inhibitor of iodine uptake through inhibiting the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the thyroid follicular cell membrane. This results in a potential decrease in thyroid hormone synthesis including thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3). In addition, this agent decreases the accumulation of the radioactive imaging substance and Hofmeister series ion, pertechnetate Tc 99m, in the choroid plexus and in the salivary and thyroid glands through competitive displacing.
