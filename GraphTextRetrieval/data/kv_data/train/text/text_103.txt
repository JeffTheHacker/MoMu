it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (S)-3-methylthiohexyl butyrate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (S)-3-methylthiohexyl butyrate can be found in fruits. This makes (S)-3-methylthiohexyl butyrate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
