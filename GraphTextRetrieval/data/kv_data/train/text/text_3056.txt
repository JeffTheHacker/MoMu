it is the dipivalate ester of (+-)-epinephrine (racepinephrine). A pro-drug of epinephrine, the hydrochloride is used topically as eye drops to reduce intra-ocular pressure in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It has a role as a prodrug, an adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent, an antiglaucoma drug and an ophthalmology drug. It is a member of ethanolamines and a pivalate ester. It derives from an adrenaline. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an ester prodrug of epinephrine, with sympathomimetic activity. Due to its lipophilicity, it penetrates more easily to the anterior chamber of the eye and is hydrolyzed to epinephrine, when applied locally. Epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, enhances the outflow of aqueous humor and decreases the production of aqueous humor by vasoconstriction. The overall result is a reduction in intraocular pressure.
