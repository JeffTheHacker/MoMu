it is a steroid ester comprising beclomethasone having propionyl groups at the 17- and 21-positions. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug, an anti-asthmatic drug, a prodrug and an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a steroid ester, an enone, a 20-oxo steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a propanoate ester, a corticosteroid, a glucocorticoid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a chlorinated steroid. It derives from a beclomethasone. it is the dipropionate ester of a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, beclomethasone enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production.
