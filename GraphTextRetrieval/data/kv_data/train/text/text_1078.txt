it is a member of the class of the class of phenylethanolamines that is (1S)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylethan-1-ol in which the pro-S hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a methyl group. It has a role as a sympathomimetic agent, an anti-asthmatic drug, a bronchodilator agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a central nervous system drug, a nasal decongestant, a xenobiotic and a plant metabolite. It is a secondary alcohol, a secondary amino compound and a member of phenylethanolamines. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a phenethylamine and a diastereomer of ephedrine with sympathomimetic property. it displaces norepinephrine from storage vesicles in presynaptic neurones, thereby releasing norepinephrine into the neuronal synapses where it stimulates primarily alpha-adrenergic receptors. It also has weak direct agonist activity at alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptors. Receptor stimulation results in vasoconstriction and decreases nasal and sinus congestion.
