4-Ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene, also known as 1, 2-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-benzene or 3, 4-dimethoxyphenylethane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dimethoxybenzenes. These are organic aromatic compounds containing a monocyclic benzene moiety carrying exactly two methoxy groups. 4-Ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4-Ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene is an earthy and musty tasting compound that can be found in coffee and coffee products and tea. This makes 4-ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
