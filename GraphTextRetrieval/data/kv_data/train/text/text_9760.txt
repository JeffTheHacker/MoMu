it is a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine having a nitrile group at position 3 and a 3-(N-ethylacetamido)phenyl substituent at the 7-position. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, a central nervous system depressant, a sedative and an anxiolytic drug. It is a pyrazolopyrimidine and a nitrile. it is a nonbenzodiazepine from the pyrazolopyrimidine class with hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties. it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -A receptor, thereby affecting the chloride channel ionophore complex and potentiating the inhibitory effects of GABA. In addition, it binds selectively to the brain omega-1 receptor situated on the alpha subunit of the GABA-A/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding.
