it is the orally bioavailable hydrochloride salt of a synthetic, small-molecule ghrelin mimetic with appetite-stimulating and anabolic activities. Anamorelin binds to and stimulates the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) centrally, thereby mimicking the appetite-stimulating and growth hormone-releasing effects of grhelin. Stimulation of GHSR may also reduce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, which may play a direct role in cancer-related loss of appetite.
