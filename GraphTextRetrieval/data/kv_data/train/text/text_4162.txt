it appears as white to yellowish-white fine crystalline powder. No odor or taste. (NTP, 1992) it is a sulfonamide, a member of thiadiazoles and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It has a role as a diuretic, an anticonvulsant and an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). It derives from a hydride of a 1,3,4-thiadiazole. it is a sulfonamide derivative with diuretic, antiglaucoma, and anticonvulsant properties. it is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme found in cells in the proximal tube of the kidney, the eye, and glial cells. Inhibition of this enzyme in the kidney prevents excretion of hydrogen, leading to increased bicarbonate and cation excretion and increased urinary volume, which results in an alkaline diuresis. it reduces the concentration of bicarbonate, resulting in a decreased synthesis of aqueous humor in the eye, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, it has anti-convulsant properties resulting from indirect effects secondary to metabolic acidosis or direct effects on neuronal transmission. it also produces respiratory stimulant effects in response to changes to both carbon dioxide and oxygen tension levels within the lungs.
