it is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor which is used in combination with diet and exercise in the therapy of type 2 diabetes, either alone or in combination with other oral hypoglycemic agents. it is a relatively new medication and has yet to be implicated in causing clinically apparent liver injury. it is a potent, selective and competitive, cyanopyrrolidine-based, orally bioavailable inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), with hypoglycemic activity. it is metabolized into an, although less potent, active mono-hydroxy metabolite.
