it is a penicillanic acid ester that is the [(2,2-dimethylpropanoyl)oxy]methyl ester and prodrug of mecillinam. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an antibacterial drug and a prodrug. It is a penicillanic acid ester, a penicillin and a pivaloyloxymethyl ester. It derives from a mecillinam. it is the pivoxil ester form of a semisynthetic, broad spectrum beta-lactam penicillin with antibacterial activity. Amdinocillin specifically binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing cell lysis.
