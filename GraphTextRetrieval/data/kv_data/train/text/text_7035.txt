, also known as 2-oxo-3-pentanol or fema 3550, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyloins. These are organic compounds containing an alpha hydroxy ketone. Acyloins are formally derived from reductive coupling of carboxylic acyl groups. Thus, is considered to be an oxygenated hydrocarbon lipid molecule. is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, can be found in milk and milk products. This makes a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
