Alpha-it, also known as dihydroqinghaosu, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as artemisinins. These are sesquiterpenoids originally isolated from the herb Artemisia annua. Their structure is based on artemisinin, a tetracyclic compound that contains a 1, 2-dioxepane fused to an octahydrobenzopyran moiety. The internal peroxide bridge is believed to be a key to the mode of action of artemisinins. Alpha-it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Alpha-it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, Alpha-dihydroartemisinin is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
