it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in potato. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
