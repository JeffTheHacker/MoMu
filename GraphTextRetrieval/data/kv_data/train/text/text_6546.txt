it is a hydrochloride salt that is obtained by reaction of vanoxerine with two equivalents of hydrogen chloride. Potent, competitive inhibitor of dopamine uptake (Ki = 1 nM for inhibition of striatal dopamine uptake). Has > 100-fold lower affinity for the noradrenalin and 5-HT uptake carriers. Also a potent sigma ligand (IC50 = 48 nM). Centrally active following systemic administration. It has a role as a dopamine uptake inhibitor. It contains a vanoxerine(2+).
