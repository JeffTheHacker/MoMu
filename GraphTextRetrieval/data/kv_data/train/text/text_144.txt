R-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkylthioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by two alkyl groups. R-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, R-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, R-it can be found in fruits. This makes R-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
