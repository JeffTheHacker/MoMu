it appears as colorless or yellowish powder. Possible bluish color depending on copper content. (NTP, 1992) it A2 is a it. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a metabolite. it A2 is the primary it species in it sulfate, a mixture of the sulfate salts of several basic glycopeptide antineoplastic antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces verticillus. it A2 forms complexes with iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA; these reactive oxygen species also induce lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and alterations in prostaglandin synthesis and degradation.
