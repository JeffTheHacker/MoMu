it, also known as N-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isothiocyanates. These are organic compounds containing the isothiocyanate group, an isocyanate analogue with the general formula RN=C=S. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1-isothiocyanatopentane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it is a green tasting compound that can be found in brassicas. This makes 1-isothiocyanatopentane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
