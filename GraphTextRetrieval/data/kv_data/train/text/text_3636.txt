it is a sulfur-containing carboxylic acid that is succinic acid bearing two mercapto substituents at positions 2 and 3. A lead chelator used as an antedote to lead poisoning. It has a role as a chelator. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a dithiol and a sulfur-containing carboxylic acid. it is an orally active mercaptodicarboxylic acid, with heavy metal chelating activity. As a strong chelator, it is able to bind to heavy metals, such as lead, in the bloodstream, thereby forming a water-soluble complex that can be eliminated via urinary excretion. This prevents heavy metal poisoning. In addition, it is able to chelate the alpha particle emitter and radionuclide polonium Po 210 ((Po-210), thereby increasing its excretion and reducing the toxic effects of Po-210.
