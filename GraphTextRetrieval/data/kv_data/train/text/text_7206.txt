N-allyl-6-chloro-1-(3-methylphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-benzazepinium-7,8-diol is a benzazepine that is 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-benzazepine bearing a 3-methylphenyl substituent at position 1, an allyl substituent at position 3, a chloro substituent at position 6 and two hydroxy substituents at positions 7 and 8. High affinity, selective dopamine D1-like receptor agonist. Ki values are 3.2, 3.1, 186, 66, 335, 1167, 1251 and 1385 nM at recombinant D1, D5, D2, D3, D4, 5-HT2A, alpha1A and alpha1B receptors respectively. Stimulates adenylyl cyclase (EC50 = 65 nM) but not phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Induces extreme arousal and hyperlocomotion following subcutaneous administration in monkeys. It has a role as a dopamine agonist. It is a benzazepine, a member of catechols, an organochlorine compound and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate acid of a N-allyl-6-chloro-1-(3-methylphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-benzazepinium-7,8-diol(1+).
