2, 4-Diethylthiazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4-disubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4-disubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at the positions 2 and 3. 2, 4-Diethylthiazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 4-diethylthiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 4-Diethylthiazole exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, 2, 4-diethylthiazole can be found in coffee and coffee products and mushrooms. This makes 2, 4-diethylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
