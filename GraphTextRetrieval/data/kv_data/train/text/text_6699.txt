it appears as odorless or almost odorless pale yellow crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a 2-aminopurine that is the 6-thiono derivative of 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-6H-purine. Incorporates into DNA and inhibits synthesis. Used in the treatment of leukaemia. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite and an anticoronaviral agent. it Anhydrous is the anhydrous salt form of it, a synthetic guanosine analogue antimetabolite, with antineoplastic activity. it is phosphorylated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase to 6-thioguanylic acid (TGMP) and upon conversion to thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP), this agent is incorporated into DNA and RNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death. This agent also inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, thereby inhibiting purine ribonulceotide synthesis.
