it is an imidazole fungicidal agent with a very broad spectrum of activity against many fungal species that is used for treatment of superficial and systemic fungal infections. it is a well documented cause of clinically apparent acute drug induced liver injury and is no longer recommended as a first line antifungal agent. it is a synthetic derivative of phenylpiperazine with broad antifungal properties and potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits sterol 14-a-dimethylase, a microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, thereby disrupting synthesis of ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell wall.
