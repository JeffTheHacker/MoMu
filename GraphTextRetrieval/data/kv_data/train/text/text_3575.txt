it is a phospholipid that is the hexadecyl monoester of phosphocholine. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antiprotozoal drug, an antifungal agent, an immunomodulator, an anti-inflammatory agent, an apoptosis inducer, a protein kinase inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of phosphocholines and a phospholipid. it is an orally- and topically-active alkyl-phosphocholine compound with potential antineoplastic activity. it targets cellular membranes, modulating cell membrane permeability, membrane lipid composition, phospholipid metabolism, and mitogenic signal transduction, resulting in cell differentiation and inhibition of cell growth. This agent also inhibits the anti-apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and modulates the balance between the MAPK and pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis. As an immunomodulator, it stimulates T-cells, macrophages and the expression of interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon gamma (INF-gamma).
