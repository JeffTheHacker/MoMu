Adenosine 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate, also known as 2', 3'-cyclic AMP or adenosine cyclic 2', 3'-monophosphate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2', 3'-cyclic purine nucleotides. These are purine nucleotides in which the oxygen atoms linked to the C2 and C3 carbon atoms of the ribose moiety are both bonded the same phosphorus atom of the phosphate group. Adenosine 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Adenosine 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and blood.
