it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 2, 4-triazolo[4, 3-a][1, 4]benzodiazepines. These are aromatic compounds containing a 1, 4-benzodiazepine fused to and sharing a nitrogen atom with a 1, 2, 4-triazole ring. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
