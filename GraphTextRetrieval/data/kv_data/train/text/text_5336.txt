it is a penicillin compound having a 6beta-[3-(2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl)-5-methyl-1,2-oxazole-4-carboxamido] side-chain. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a penicillin and a penicillin allergen. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a narrow-spectrum, semisynthetic isoxazolyl penicillin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing cell lysis.
