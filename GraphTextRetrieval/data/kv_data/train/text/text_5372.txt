it, also known as 1, 2, 5, 6-tetrahydrocuminic acid or fema 3731, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-isopropyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 4-isopropyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 4-isopropyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
