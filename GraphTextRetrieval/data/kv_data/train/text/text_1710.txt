it is a member of the class of sulfamides in which the two amino groups of sulfonamide are substituted by 5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-{2-[(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yl)oxy]ethoxy}pyrimidin-4-yl and propyl groups. An orphan drug used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has a role as an endothelin receptor antagonist, an antihypertensive agent and an orphan drug. It is an organobromine compound, a member of pyrimidines, an aromatic ether, a ring assembly and a member of sulfamides. It derives from an ethylene glycol and an ACT-132577. it is an orally available dual endothelin receptor (ETR) antagonist with potential antihypertensive and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it and its metabolites block the binding of endothelin isoform 1 (ET-1) to type-A and type-B ETR on both the tumor cells and the endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature. This prevents ET-1 mediated signaling transduction which may decrease tumor cell proliferation, progression, and angiogenesis in tumor tissue. ET-1, a potent vasoconstrictor that plays an important role in inflammation and tissue repair, is, together with its receptors, overexpressed varyingly in many tumor cell types.
