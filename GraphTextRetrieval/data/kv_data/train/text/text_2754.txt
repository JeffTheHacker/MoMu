it is a 1,3,5-triazine which is substituted by (2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)nitrilo, 6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl and [2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl]nitrilo groups at positions 2,4 and 6, respectively. It is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) inhibitor which has been approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 1.1.1.42 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. It is an aminopyridine, an organofluorine compound, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary alcohol, a member of 1,3,5-triazines and an aromatic amine. it is an orally available inhibitor of specific mutant forms of the mitochondrial enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase type 2 (IDH2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it specifically inhibits various mutant forms of IDH2, including the IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K, which inhibits the formation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). This may lead to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in IDH2-expressing tumor cells. IDH2, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle, is mutated in a variety of cancers; it initiates and drives cancer growth by blocking differentiation and the production of the oncometabolite 2HG.
