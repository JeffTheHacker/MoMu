it is an organic heterotricyclic compound that is 4,9-dihydro-10H-benzo[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2-b]thiophen-10-one which is substituted at position 4 by a 1-methylpiperidin-4-ylidene group. A blocker of histamine H1 receptors with a stabilising action on mast cells, it is used (usually as its hydrogen fumarate salt) for the treatment of asthma, where it may take several weeks to exert its full effect. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist and an anti-asthmatic drug. It is an organosulfur heterocyclic compound, an organic heterotricyclic compound, a cyclic ketone, a member of piperidines, an olefinic compound and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a cycloheptathiophene derivative with anti-allergic activity. it selectively blocks histamine (H1) receptors and prevents the typical symptoms caused by histamine release. This agent also interferes with the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells involved in hypersensitivity reactions, thereby decreasing chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils.
