it appears as fine white or almost white crystalline powder. Odorless or almost odorless. Tasteless. (NTP, 1992) it is a imidazolidine-2,4-dione that consists of hydantoin bearing two phenyl substituents at position 5. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, a teratogenic agent, a drug allergen and a sodium channel blocker. It derives from a hydantoin. it is a hydantoin derivative and a non-sedative antiepileptic agent with anticonvulsant activity. it potentially acts by promoting sodium efflux from neurons located in the motor cortex reducing post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. The reduction of potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci spreading to adjacent areas, stabilizing the threshold against hyperexcitability. In addition, this agent appears to reduce sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch causing muscle relaxation.
