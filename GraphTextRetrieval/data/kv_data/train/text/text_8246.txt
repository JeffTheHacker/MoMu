it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as allyl sulfur compounds. Allyl sulfur compounds are compounds containing an allylsulfur group, with the general structure H2C(=CH2)CS. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, methyl 2-propenyl tetrasulfide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, methyl 2-propenyl tetrasulfide can be found in onion-family vegetables. This makes methyl 2-propenyl tetrasulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
