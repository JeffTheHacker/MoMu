it, also known as walrycin a, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthols and derivatives. These are naphthalene derivatives carrying one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups at any ring position. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in beverages, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
