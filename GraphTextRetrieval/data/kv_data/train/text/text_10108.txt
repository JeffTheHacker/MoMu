it appears as light yellow oil or liquid. May be a carcinogen. it is a nitrosamine that is piperidine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a nitroso group. One of the many carcinogens detected in cigarette smoke, it is found in meat, cheese and spices that have been treated with the preservative sodium nitrite. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, an apoptosis inducer, a mutagen and an environmental contaminant. It is a nitrosamine and a piperidine. it is a clear, yellow, oily, liquid that is light sensitive and emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition. it is used in laboratory research to induce tumors in experimental animals. This substance is naturally formed in foods that contain sodium nitrite as a preservative, including meat, fish and cheese, as a result of nitrosation of piperidine in the presence of nitrite. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
