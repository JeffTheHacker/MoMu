it is a white powder. pH of 0.5% aqueous solution: 5.8-6.1. (NTP, 1992) it is a sulfonamide in which the sulfamoyl functional group is attached to aniline at the 4-position. It has a role as an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor, an antibacterial agent and a drug allergen. It is a substituted aniline, a sulfonamide antibiotic and a sulfonamide. it is an organic sulfur compound structurally similar to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) with antibacterial property. it competes with PABA for the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, thereby preventing the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid, the immediate precursor of folic acid. This leads to an inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis and de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest and cell death.
