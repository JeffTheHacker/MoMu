it, also known as acetyl-beta -sitosterol or sitosterol, beta, acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Beta-sitosterol acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Beta-sitosterol acetate can be found in pulses. This makes Beta-sitosterol acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
