it is a colorless oily liquid. It is insoluble in water. The primary hazard is the threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment. Since it is a liquid it can easily penetrate the soil and contaminate groundwater and nearby streams. It is combustible though it may take some effort to ignite. It is used in paints and plastics and as a reaction media for chemical reactions. it is a phthalate ester that is the diester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy groups of phthalic acid with two molecules of butan-1-ol. Although used extensively as a plasticiser, it is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that poses a risk to humans. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a teratogenic agent, a plasticiser, a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor. It is a phthalate ester and a diester. It derives from a butan-1-ol.
