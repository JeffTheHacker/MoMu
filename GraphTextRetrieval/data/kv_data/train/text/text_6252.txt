it is an organofluorine compound that is 5-fluorocytosine substituted at the 1 position by a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl group (2R,5S configuration). It is used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is a pyrimidone, an organofluorine compound, a monothioacetal and a nucleoside analogue. it is a synthetic fluoro derivative of thiacytidine with potent antiviral activity. it is phosphorylated to form it 5'-triphosphate within the cell. This metabolite inhibits the activity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase both by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by incorporation into viral DNA causing a termination of DNA chain elongation (due to the lack of the essential 3'-OH group).
