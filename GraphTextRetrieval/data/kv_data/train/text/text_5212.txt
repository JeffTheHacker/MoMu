Carotol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Carotol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, carotol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Carotol is a mild and pleasant tasting compound that can be found in carrot, parsley, root vegetables, and wild carrot. This makes carotol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
