Iduronic acid, also known as iduronate or acid, iduronic, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glucuronic acid derivatives. Glucuronic acid derivatives are compounds containing a glucuronic acid moiety (or a derivative), which consists of a glucose moiety with the C6 carbon oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Iduronic acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Iduronic acid has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, iduronic acid is primarily located in the lysosome.
