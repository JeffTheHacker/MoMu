it is under development by Axonyx, a US biopharmaceutical company that focuses on treatments for dementia. it is a next generation acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of AD. Unlike currently marketed AChE inhibitors, it has a dual mechanism of action that also includes anti-amyloid activity, which may confer disease-modifying effects in patients with AD. If this is substantiated in an ongoing clinical trial then it may open the door to an entirely new type of treatment for AD. Axonyx announced on 20 September 2005 that it was ineffective in two curtailed phase 3 trials.
