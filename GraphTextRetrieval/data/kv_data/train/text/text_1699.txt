it is a benzoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-[(2,4-dihydroxy-6-propylbenzoyl)oxy]-2-hydroxy-6-propylbenzoic acid with the 4-hydroxy group of 2,4-dihydroxy-6-pentylbenzoic acid (olivetolic acid). It is isolated from the endophytic fungi Cytonaema and acts as an inhibitor of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) protease. It has a role as a metabolite, an antiviral agent and a protease inhibitor. It is a benzoate ester, a member of resorcinols and a monohydroxybenzoic acid. It derives from an olivetolic acid.
