it is a secondary amino compound consisting of two molecules of tacrine that are linked together through their exocyclic amino groups by a heptane-1,7-diyl chain. it is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE)inhibitor (IC50 0.40 nM, >1,000 times more potent than tacrine). It has also been found to protect against H2O2 -induced apoptosis in rat pheochromocytoma cells. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a neuroprotective agent, an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor and an apoptosis inhibitor. It derives from a tacrine.
