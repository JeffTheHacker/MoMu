(Â±)-it, also known as it or ite, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthridines and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthridine moiety, which is a tricyclic system with two benzene rings joined by a pyridine forming a non-linear skeleton. Hydrogenated derivatives are also included (Â±)-it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (Â±)-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (Â±)-it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (Â±)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
