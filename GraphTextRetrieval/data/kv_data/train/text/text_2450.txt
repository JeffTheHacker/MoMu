it has been used in trials studying the treatment and prevention of Breast Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer, Pancreatectomy for Chronic Pancreatitis, Islet Transplantation in Diabetes Mellitus Type 1, and Pancreatic Islet Transplantation in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. it is an orally available inhibitor of CXC chemokine receptor types 1 (CXCR1) and 2 (CXCR2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it allosterically binds to CXCR1 and prevents CXCR1 activation by its ligand interleukin 8 (IL-8 or CXCL8). This may cause cancer stem cell (CSC) apoptosis and may inhibit tumor cell progression and metastasis. CXCR1, overexpressed on CSCs, plays a key role in CSC survival and the ability of CSC to self-renew; it is also linked to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of the IL-8/CXCR1 interaction also potentiates the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, it inhibits CXCR2 activation and may reduce both neutrophil recruitment and vascular permeability during inflammation or injury.
