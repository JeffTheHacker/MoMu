it is an imidazoline that is 2-amino 4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazoline in which one of the exocyclic amino hydrogens has been replaced by a 4-amino-2,6-dichlorophenyl group. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, an antiglaucoma drug, an ophthalmology drug, a beta-adrenergic agonist and a diagnostic agent. It is a member of imidazolines, a dichlorobenzene and a member of guanidines. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a clonidine derivative with selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonistic activity. Upon ocular administration, it enhances aqueous humor uveoscleral outflow and decreases aqueous production by vasoconstriction. This may decrease intraocular pressure (IOP).
