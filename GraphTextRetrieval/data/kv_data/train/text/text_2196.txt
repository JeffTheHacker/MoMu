(R)-Dihydrocitronellol, also known as 3, 7-dimethyl-1-octanol or tetrahydro-geraniol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. Thus, (R)-dihydrocitronellol is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule (R)-Dihydrocitronellol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule (R)-Dihydrocitronellol has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (R)-dihydrocitronellol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm (R)-Dihydrocitronellol is an aldehydic, bitter, and citrus tasting compound that can be found in lemon. This makes (R)-dihydrocitronellol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
