(+)-it is an it that has R,R,R configuration. The naturally occurring stereoisomer of it, it is found particularly in sunflower and olive oils. It has a role as an antioxidant, a nutraceutical, a vitamin, an antiatherogenic agent, an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor, an anticoagulant, an immunomodulator, an antiviral agent, a micronutrient and an algal metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a (-)-it. it is a naturally-occurring form of it, a fat-soluble vitamin with potent antioxidant properties. Considered essential for the stabilization of biological membranes (especially those with high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids), d-it is a potent peroxyl radical scavenger and inhibits noncompetitively cyclooxygenase activity in many tissues, resulting in a decrease in prostaglandin production. it also inhibits angiogenesis and tumor dormancy through suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription. (NCI04) Tocopherol is a class of it compounds naturally found in many different sources, such as oils, nuts, and vegetables. Tocopherols have antioxidant activity. it is the orally bioavailable alpha form of the naturally-occurring fat-soluble it, with potent antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Upon administration, it neutralizes free radicals, thereby protecting tissues and organs from oxidative damage. Alpha-tocopherol gets incorporated into biological membranes, prevents protein oxidation and inhibits lipid peroxidation, thereby maintaining cell membrane integrity and protecting the cell against damage. In addition, it inhibits the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-mediated pathways. Alpha-tocopherol also modulates the expression of various genes, plays a key role in neurological function, inhibits platelet aggregation and enhances vasodilation. Compared with other forms of tocopherol, it is the most biologically active form and is the form that is preferentially absorbed and retained in the body.
