it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Colorectal Cancer, Renal Cell Cancer, Colorectal Cancer Recurrent, Colorectal Cancer Metastatic, and Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits several RTKs, dysregulated in a variety of tumors, including stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit; SCFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinases Flt1 and Flt3. Inhibition of these RTKs may result in an inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis, and eventually tumor regression in tumor cells overexpressing these RTKs.
