(13R, 14R)-7-Labdene-13, 14, 15-triol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units (13R, 14R)-7-Labdene-13, 14, 15-triol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (13R, 14R)-7-labdene-13, 14, 15-triol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (13R, 14R)-7-labdene-13, 14, 15-triol can be found in fats and oils. This makes (13R, 14R)-7-labdene-13, 14, 15-triol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
