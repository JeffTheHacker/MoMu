it is the maleate salt of amlodipine, a synthetic phenylpyridine vasodilator with antihypertensive and antianginal effects. Amlodipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and peripheral vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby preventing vascular and myocardial contraction. Furthermore, decreased myocardial contractility and dilation of the main coronary and systemic arteries lead to increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue and decreases total peripheral resistance. This agent may also modulate multi-drug resistance (MDR) activity through inhibition of the p-glycoprotein efflux pump.
