it is a cyclic amine and alpha-methyl derivative of amantadine with antiviral activity. Although the exact mechanism of action of it is not understood, this agent appears to exert its antiviral effect against influenza A virus by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein, thereby preventing the uncoating of the virus and subsequent release of infectious viral nucleic acids into the cytoplasm of infected cells.
