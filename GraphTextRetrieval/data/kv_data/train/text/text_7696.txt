The fixed combination of phentermine and topiramate has been developed as a weight loss agent and was approved for use in the United States in 2012. This combination has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury, but has had limited general use. Topiramate by itself is used as an anticonvulsant and has been implicated in rare instances of acute liver injury.
