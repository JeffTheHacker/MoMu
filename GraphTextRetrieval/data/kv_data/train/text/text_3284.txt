it is an ortho- and peri-fused polycyclic arene. It has a role as a mutagen and a human metabolite. Dibenzo (a,l) pyrene is a yellowish-reddish, carcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of six fused rings and produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Dibenzo[a,e]pyrene is primarily found in coal gasification products, cigarette smoke and fossil fuels. This substance is used only for research purposes to induce tumorigenesis. Dibenzo[a,e]pyrene is a mutagen and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
