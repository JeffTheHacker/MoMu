it appears as white, odorless powder or colorless crystals. Practically insoluble in water. Occurs extensive in rocks world-wide. Ground it (CAS: 1317-65-3) results directly from the mining of it. The extraction process keeps the carbonate very close to its original state of purity and delivers a finely ground product either in dry or slurry form. Precipitated it (CAS: it) is produced industrially by the decomposition of it to calcium oxide followed by subsequent recarbonization or as a by-product of the Solvay process (which is used to make sodium carbonate). Precipitated it is purer than ground it and has different (and tailorable) handling properties. it is a calcium salt with formula CCaO3. It has a role as an antacid, a food colouring, a food firming agent and a fertilizer. It is a calcium salt, a carbonate salt and a one-carbon compound. Calcium Carbonate is the carbonic salt of calcium (CaCO3). it is used therapeutically as a phosphate buffer in hemodialysis, as an antacid in gastric hyperacidity for temporary relief of indigestion and heartburn, and as a calcium supplement for preventing and treating osteoporosis.
