(2R,4S)-it is a 1-(4-{[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy}phenyl)-4-isopropylpiperazine in which positions 2 and 4 of the 1,3-dioxolane moiety have R and S configuration, respectively. It is an enantiomer of a (2S,4R)-it. it is a synthetic triazole derivative structurally related to fluconazole, antifungal it seems to disrupt cell wall synthesis by inhibiting biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell membrane, altering its permeability, and promoting loss of essential intracellular elements. it is active against Candida sp.. (NCI04)
