it is a didemnin that is didemin B in which the hydroxy group of the 1-(2-hydroxypropanoyl)-L-prolinamide moiety has been oxidised to the corresponding ketone. It was originally isolated from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans. It has a role as a marine metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. it is a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the marine tunicate Aplidium albicans. it displays a broad spectrum of antitumor activities, inducing apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial cytochrome c release, initiating the Fas/DC95, JNK pathway and activating caspase 3 activation. This agent also inhibits elongation factor 1-a, thereby interfering with protein synthesis, and induces G1 arrest and G2 blockade, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth.
