it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in garden tomato. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
