Methyl 4-chloro-1H-indole-3-acetate, also known as 4-chloro-indoleacetic acid methyl ester, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indole-3-acetic acid derivatives. Indole-3-acetic acid derivatives are compounds containing an acetic acid (or a derivative) linked to the C3 carbon atom of an indole. Methyl 4-chloro-1H-indole-3-acetate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, methyl 4-chloro-1H-indole-3-acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, methyl 4-chloro-1H-indole-3-acetate can be found in a number of food items such as lentils, broad bean, pulses, and common pea. This makes methyl 4-chloro-1H-indole-3-acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
