it is a member of the class of 8,8'-bicoumarins resulting from the formal oxidative dimerisation of 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-2H-chromen-2-one (the S-(+) enantiomer). A fungal metabolite, its isolation from Aspergillus clavatus was first reported in 1971. It has a role as a metabolite. It derives from an orlandin.
