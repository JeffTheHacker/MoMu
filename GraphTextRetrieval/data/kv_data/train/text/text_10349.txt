Phorbol 13-acetate 12-myristate is a phorbol ester that is phorbol in which the hydroxy groups at the cyclopropane ring juction (position 13) and the adjacent carbon (position 12) have been converted into the corresponding acetate and myristate esters. It has a role as a protein kinase C agonist and an antineoplastic agent. It is an acetate ester, a tetradecanoate ester, a diester, a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a phorbol ester. Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate is a phorbol ester with potential antineoplastic effects. Tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) induces maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines, including leukemic cells. This agent may induce gene expression and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. In addition to potential antineoplastic effects, TPA may exhibit tumor promoting activity. (NCI04)
