it, also known as 6-ethyl-4, 5, 7-trithiadecane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkyldisulfides. These are organic compounds containing a disulfide group R-SS-R' where R and R' are both alkyl groups. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, propyl 1-(propylthio)propyl disulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, propyl 1-(propylthio)propyl disulfide can be found in garden onion and onion-family vegetables. This makes propyl 1-(propylthio)propyl disulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
