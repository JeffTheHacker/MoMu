it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxepanes. Oxepanes are compounds containing an oxepane ring, which is a seven-member saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one oxygen and six carbon atoms. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
