it, also known as it or 2-(alpha-methylvinyl)pyrazine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (1-methylethenyl)pyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm it is a caramellic, chocolate, and nutty tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as cocoa and cocoa products, coffee and coffee products, nuts, and tea. This makes (1-methylethenyl)pyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
