it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 7-o-methylated flavonoids. These are flavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C7 atom of the flavonoid backbone. Thus, 6-methyltectochrysin is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 6-methyltectochrysin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 6-methyltectochrysin can be found in tea. This makes 6-methyltectochrysin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
