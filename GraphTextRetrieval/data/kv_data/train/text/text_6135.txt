it is an oxopurine that is theophylline bearing a 2,3-dihydroxypropyl group at the 7 position. It has broncho- and vasodilator properties, and is used in the treatment of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis. It is also an ingredient in preparations that have been promoted for coughs. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a vasodilator agent, an EC 3.1.4.* (phosphoric diester hydrolase) inhibitor and a muscle relaxant. It is an oxopurine and a member of propane-1,2-diols. it is a xanthine derivative. Dyphilline exerts bronchodilator effects and to a lesser extent vasodilator and diuretic properties. Dyphilline probably acts as a competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase which leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP. This results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and other smooth muscles. it may also antagonize adenosine receptors. it is used in the treatment of acute bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
