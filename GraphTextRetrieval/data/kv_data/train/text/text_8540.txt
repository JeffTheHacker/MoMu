it is an organic sodium salt that is the monosodium salt of p-aminohippuric acid. It has a role as a diagnostic agent. It contains a p-aminohippurate. Sodium salt of aminohippuric acid. it is used as a non-toxic diagnostic tool to measure effective renal plasma flow. At low plasma concentration this agent is filtered by the glomeruli and almost completely cleared from the renal blood stream by active tubular secretion in a single transit through the kidney. Its clearance corresponds to the renal plasma blood flow. it is also used to measure functional capacity of the renal tubular secretory mechanism. This is achieved by elevating the drug plasma concentration to levels sufficient to saturate the maximal secretion capacity of the tubular cells.
