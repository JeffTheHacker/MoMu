it is an organic nitrate salt obtained by reaction of equimolar amounts of butaconazole and nitric acid. An antifungal agent, it is used in gynaecology for treatment of vulvovaginal infections caused by Candida species, particularly Candida albicans. It is an organic nitrate salt, an aryl sulfide, a member of imidazoles, an imidazole antifungal drug and a conazole antifungal drug. It contains a butoconazole(1+). it is the nitrate salt form of butaconazole, a synthetic imidazole derivative with fungistatic properties. it interferes with steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, thereby changing the fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This alters cell permeability and leads to growth inhibition. Butaconazole nitrate is active against many dermatophytes and yeasts. It also contains antibacterial effects against some gram-positive organisms.
