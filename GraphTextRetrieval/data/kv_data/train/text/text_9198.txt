it is an epithilone that is epithilone D in which the double bond in the macrocyclic ring has been oxidised to the corresponding epoxide (the S,S stereoisomer). It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-stabilising agent. It is an epothilone and an epoxide. it is a compound isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum. Similar to paclitaxel, patupilone induces microtubule polymerization and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization conditions. In addition to promoting tubulin polymerization and stabilization of microtubules, this agent is cytotoxic for cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein, a characteristic that distinguishes it from the taxanes. it may cause complete cell-cycle arrest.
