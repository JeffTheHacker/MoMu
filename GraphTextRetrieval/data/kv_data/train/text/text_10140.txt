it appears as odorless or nearly odorless pale yellow needles or powder that darkens on exposure to light. Used to treat gouty arthritis, pseudogout, sarcoidal arthritis and calcific tendinitis. (EPA, 1998) (S)-it is a it and an alkaloid. It has a role as a mutagen. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-it. it is an alkaloid isolated from Colchicum autumnale with anti-gout and anti-inflammatory activities. The exact mechanism of action by which its exerts its effect has not been completely established. it binds to tubulin, thereby interfering with the polymerization of tubulin, interrupting microtubule dynamics, and disrupting mitosis. This leads to an inhibition of migration of leukocytes and other inflammatory cells, thereby reducing the inflammatory response to deposited urate crystals. it may also interrupt the cycle of monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint tissues, thereby also preventing the resultant inflammatory response. Overall, it decreases leukocyte chemotaxis/migration and phagocytosis to inflamed areas, and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein that is produced during phagocytosis of urate crystals.
