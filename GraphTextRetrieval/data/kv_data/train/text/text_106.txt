it appears as colorless to white crystalline solid or white powder. Sublimes at 284Â°F. Odorless. Bitter taste. pH (saturated aqueous solution) 9.8. (NTP, 1992) it is a morphinane alkaloid found in the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum var. album; has analgesic, anti-tussive and anti-diarrhoeal properties. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, an antitussive, an opioid receptor agonist, a prodrug, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a drug allergen. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a morphinane alkaloid. It derives from a morphine. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a naturally occurring phenanthrene alkaloid and opioid agonist with analgesic, antidiarrheal and antitussive activities. it mimics the actions of endogenous opioids by binding to the opioid receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of mu-subtype opioid receptors results in a decrease in the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline; in addition, the it metabolite morphine induces opening of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and blocks the opening of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Stimulation of gut mu-subtype opioid receptors results in a reduction in intestinal motility and delayed intestinal transit times. Antitussive activity is mediated through it's action on the cough center in the medulla.
