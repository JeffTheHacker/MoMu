it, also known as N-3-cl-4-hmpa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminobenzoic acids. These are benzoic acids containing an amine group attached to the benzene moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, N-(2-methyl-3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)anthranilic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
