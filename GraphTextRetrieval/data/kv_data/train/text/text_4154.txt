it is a glyceryl guaiacolate with expectorant effects. it increases respiratory tract mucus secretions, acts as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors and recruits efferent parasympathetic reflexes that cause glandular exocytosis. This agent reduces the viscosity of mucus secretion by reducing adhesiveness and surface tension as well as increasing hydration of mucus. it promotes the efficiency of the mucociliary mechanism important in removing accumulated secretions from the upper and lower airway.
