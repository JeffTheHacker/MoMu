(2S)-it is a flavanone glycoside that is 4'-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone attached to a neohesperidose (alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranose) residue via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the fruits of Poncirus trifoliata and exhibits inhibitory activity against liopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a monomethoxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside, a disaccharide derivative, a neohesperidoside and a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones. It derives from a 4'-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone.
