Sodium meclofenamate monohydrate is a hydrate that is the monohydrate of the sodium salt of meclofenamic acid. It is used for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea (painful periods), osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as an analgesic, an anticonvulsant, an antineoplastic agent, an antipyretic, an antirheumatic drug, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It contains a sodium meclofenamate (anhydrous). Meclofenamate Sodium is the sodium salt form of meclofenamate, an anthranilic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. Meclofenamate sodium inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, by prostaglandin synthase, is responsible for the therapeutic effects of meclofenamate sodium. Meclofenamate sodium also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
