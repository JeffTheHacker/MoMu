it (imino form) is a it. It is a tautomer of a it (amino form). it is an imidazoline derivate and centrally-acting alpha-adrenergic agonist, with antihypertensive activity. it binds to and stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, thereby reducing the amount of norepinephrine (NE) release and thus decreasing sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature. The reduction in sympathetic outflow leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, and decreased heart rate. In addition, it binds to imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1), which may also contribute to a reduction in blood pressure.
