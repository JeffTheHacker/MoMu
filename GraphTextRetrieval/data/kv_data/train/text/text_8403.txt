TG(16:0/20:0/16:0), also known as triacylglycerol or tag(52:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triacylglycerols. These are glycerides consisting of three fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) has been found in human adipose tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and adiposome. TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) can be biosynthesized from DG(16:0/20:0/0:0) and palmityl-CoA through the action of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase. In humans, TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) is involved in the metabolic disorder called de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(16:0/20:0/16:0) pathway.
