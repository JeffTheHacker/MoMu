it is the acetate salt form of pirbuterol, a synthetic catecholamine and a pyridine derivative with sympathomimetic and bronchodilatory effects. it selectively stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, resulting in initiation of intracellular adenylate cyclase activity leading to increased levels of cAMP. As a result muscle relaxation (broncho- and vasodilation) occurs via cAMP-dependent signal transduction. In addition, elevated levels of cAMP inhibit release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.
