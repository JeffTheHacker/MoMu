Propionyl-CoA, also known as propanoyl-coa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Propionyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Propionyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, propionyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and peroxisome. Propionyl-CoA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA can be converted into chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA through the action of the enzyme non-specific lipid-transfer protein. In addition, Choloyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA can be biosynthesized from 3a, 7a, 12a-trihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA; which is mediated by the enzyme non-specific lipid-transfer protein. In humans, propionyl-CoA is involved in bile acid biosynthesis pathway, congenital bile acid synthesis defect type II pathway, the oxidation OF branched chain fatty acids pathway, and the valproic Acid metabolism pathway. Propionyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the malonic aciduria pathway, 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase deficiency type I, the refsum disease pathway, and methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Propionyl-CoA is a potentially toxic compound.
