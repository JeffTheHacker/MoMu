2, 4-Diisopropyl-3-methylphenol, also known as 2, 4-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cumenes. These are aromatic compounds containing a prop-2-ylbenzene moiety. 2, 4-Diisopropyl-3-methylphenol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 4-diisopropyl-3-methylphenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 4-diisopropyl-3-methylphenol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 4-diisopropyl-3-methylphenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
