Phytuberin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Phytuberin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, phytuberin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, phytuberin can be found in potato. This makes phytuberin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
