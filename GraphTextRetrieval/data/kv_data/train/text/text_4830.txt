it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2'-o-methylated isoflavonoids. These are isoflavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C2' atom of the isoflavonoid backbone. Isoflavonoids are natural products derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits, lima bean, and scarlet bean. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
