Ginsenoside b2 belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Ginsenoside b2 exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ginsenoside B2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, ginsenoside B2 can be found in tea. This makes ginsenoside B2 a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
