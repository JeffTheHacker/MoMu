5, 7-Dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone, also known as 3'-hydroxy-3, 9-dihydroeucomin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as homoisoflavanones. These are homoisoflavonoids with a structure based on the chromanone system. Chromanone is a bicyclic compound consisting of a 3, 4-dihydro-1-benzopyran, which bears a ketone group at the 4-position. 5, 7-Dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 5, 7-dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 5, 7-dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 5, 7-dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
