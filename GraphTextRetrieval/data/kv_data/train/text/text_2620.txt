it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quinolizines. Quinolizines are compounds containing a quinolizine moiety, which consists of two fused pyridine rings sharing a nitrogen atom. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in bilberry and fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
