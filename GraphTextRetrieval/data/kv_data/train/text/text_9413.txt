20a-Hydroxy cholesterol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cholesterols and derivatives. Cholesterols and derivatives are compounds containing a 3-hydroxylated cholestane core. Thus, 20a-hydroxy cholesterol is considered to be a sterol lipid molecule. 20a-Hydroxy cholesterol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 20a-Hydroxy cholesterol has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 20a-hydroxy cholesterol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, 20a-hydroxy cholesterol is involved in the steroidogenesis pathway. 20a-Hydroxy cholesterol is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include adrenal hyperplasia type 3 or congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (cyp11b1), the apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome pathway, and adrenal hyperplasia type 5 or congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 Alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.
