it is an acetate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the 21-hydroxy function of 6alpha-methylprednisolone compound with acetic acid. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a 20-oxo steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, an acetate ester, a steroid ester, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a 6alpha-methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone Acetate is the acetate salt of a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist with immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory effects. it is converted into active prednisolone in the body, which activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. This includes inducing synthesis of anti-inflammatory protein IkappaB-alpha and inhibiting synthesis of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). As a result, proinflammatory cytokine production such as IL-1, IL-2 and IL-6 is down-regulated and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation is inhibited. Therefore, an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions may be achieved.
