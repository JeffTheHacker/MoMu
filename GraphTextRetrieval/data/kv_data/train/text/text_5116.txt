it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ortho cresols. These are organic compounds containing an ortho-cresol moiety, which consists of a benzene bearing one hydroxyl group at ring positions 1 and 2, respectively. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, 4-ethyl-2-methylphenol can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 4-ethyl-2-methylphenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
