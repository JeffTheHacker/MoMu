it appears as yellow amorphous solid or orange-red crystals. Latter have greenish-yellow fluorescence by reflected light. Insoluble in water. Soluble in dilute aqueous bases. Very dilute alkaline solutions exhibit intense, greenish-yellow fluorescence by reflected light. Low toxicity. May be sensitive to prolonged exposure to light. it is a xanthene dye that is highly fluorescent, detectable even when present in minute quantities. Used forensically to detect traces of blood, in analytical chemistry as an indicator in silver nitrate titrations and in microscopy. It has a role as a radioopaque medium and a fluorescent dye. It is a xanthene dye, a gamma-lactone, a polyphenol, an oxaspiro compound, a member of 2-benzofurans and an organic heteropentacyclic compound. It derives from a fluoran. it is an organic compound that has wide use as a synthetic coloring agent. It is prepared by heating phthalic anhydride and resorcinol over a zinc catalyst, and it crystallizes as a deep red powder. This agent emits an intense green fluorescence in the presence of alkaline solutions and therefore is used as a label when conjugated to antibodies or as a contrast agent for ophthalmic angiography.
