it is the lead clinical development candidate from a series of highly selective peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists. In preclinical studies, it was highly selective for the peripheral kappa opioid receptor. Preclinical animal studies suggest that it is a potent analgesic compound. In addition, unlike currently marketed opioids, it does not produce inhibition of intestinal transit (ileus), induce respiratory depression, or elicit signs of euphoria or addiction in animal models. Preclinical studies also indicate that it possesses anti-inflammatory activities.
