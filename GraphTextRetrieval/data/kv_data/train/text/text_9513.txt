it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty amides. These are carboxylic acid amide derivatives of fatty acids, that are formed from a fatty acid and an amine. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty amide lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
