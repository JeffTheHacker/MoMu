Halofuginone, also known as stenorol or C16H17BRCLN3O3, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quinazolines. Quinazolines are compounds containing a quinazoline moiety, which is made up of two fused six-member aromatic rings, a benzene ring and a pyrimidine ring. Halofuginone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, halofuginone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Halofuginone is an orally-active quinazolinone alkaloid with potential antineoplastic activity. Halofuginone interferes with the signaling pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and inhibits expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2, thereby inhibiting collagen type I synthesis and inducing extracellular matrix degradation, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor growth, or metastasis.
