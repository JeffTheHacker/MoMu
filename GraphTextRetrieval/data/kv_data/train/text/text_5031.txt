it, also known as 5'-diphosphoribose, adenosine or itose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purine nucleotide sugars. These are purine nucleotides bound to a saccharide derivative through the terminal phosphate group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human prostate tissue. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it can be converted into D-ribose 5-phosphate through the action of the enzyme ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase. In humans, it is involved in the nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathway, the azathioprine action pathway, the mercaptopurine action pathway, and the glutamate metabolism pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the xanthinuria type I pathway, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, adenosine deaminase deficiency, and the mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome pathway.
