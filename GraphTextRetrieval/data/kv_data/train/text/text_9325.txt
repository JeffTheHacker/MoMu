it is a member of the class of 2-benzofurans that is 2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one which is substituted at positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 by methyl, methoxy, (2E)-5-carboxy-3-methylpent-2-en-1-yl, and hydroxy groups, respectively. It is an antibiotic produced by Penicillium brevi-compactum, P. stoloniferum, P. echinulatum and related species. An immunosuppressant, it is widely used (partiularly as its sodium salt and as the 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl ester prodrug, it mofetil) to prevent tissue rejection following organ transplants and for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimicrobial agent, an EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP dehydrogenase) inhibitor, an immunosuppressive agent, a mycotoxin, a Penicillium metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a gamma-lactone, a member of phenols, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of 2-benzofurans. It derives from a hex-4-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it. it is an antineoplastic antibiotic derived from various Penicillium fungal species. it is an active metabolite of the prodrug it mofetil. it inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), preventing the formation of guanosine monophosphate and synthesis of lymphocyte DNA that results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, antibody production, cellular adhesion, and migration of T and B lymphocytes. it also has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities.
