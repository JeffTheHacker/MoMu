it, also known as 1-methoxy-3-formylindole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indoles. Indoles are compounds containing an indole moiety, which consists of pyrrole ring fused to benzene to form 2, 3-benzopyrrole. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 1-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde can be found in root vegetables. This makes 1-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
