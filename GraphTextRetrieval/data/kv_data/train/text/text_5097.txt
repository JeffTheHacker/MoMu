it, also known as 6847-93-4 or 9-berberoline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as protoberberine alkaloids and derivatives. These are alkaloids with a structure based on a protoberberine moiety, which consists of a 5, 6-dihydrodibenzene moiety fused to a quinolizinium and forming 5, 6-Dihydrodibenzo(a, g)quinolizinium skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, ite is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, ite can be found in fruits and tea. This makes ite a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
