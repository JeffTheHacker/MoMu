it is a long acting glyco-pegylated recombinant form of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), with hematopoietic activity. Similar to G-CSF, it binds to and activates specific cell surface receptors, and stimulates neutrophil progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, this agent may prevent the duration and incidence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Compared to filgrastim, it has a prolonged plasma half-life.
