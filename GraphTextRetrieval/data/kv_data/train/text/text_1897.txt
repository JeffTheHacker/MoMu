it, also known as passiedulin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyanogenic glycosides. These are glycosides in which the aglycone moiety contains a cyanide group it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetonitrile O-b-D-allopyranoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetonitrile O-b-D-allopyranoside can be found in fruits. This makes (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetonitrile O-b-D-allopyranoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
