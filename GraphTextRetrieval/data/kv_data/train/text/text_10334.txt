2, 2, 6, 6-Tetramethyl-4-piperidinone, also known as tempidon or tmpone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as piperidinones. Piperidinones are compounds containing a piperidine ring which bears a ketone. 2, 2, 6, 6-Tetramethyl-4-piperidinone exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinone can be found in green vegetables and tea. This makes 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
