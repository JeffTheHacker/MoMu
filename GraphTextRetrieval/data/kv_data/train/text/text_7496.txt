it is a derivative of succinic acid in which one of the carboxy groups is esterified by the C-21 hydroxy group of cortisol (hydrocortisone). It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a hemisuccinate and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a cortisol. it is the synthetic hemisuccinate salt form of hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Hydrocortisone acetate initially binds to the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor; then the receptor-ligand complex is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of genes encoding for anti-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
