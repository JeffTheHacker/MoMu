it is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug and exerts a mechanism of action similar to other Î²-lactam antibiotics. Unlike other agents in this category, it is a siderophore able to undergo active transport into the bacterial cell through iron channels. It represents a significant addition to antibacterial treatment option as it has proven to be effective *in vitro* against multidrug resistant strains including extended spectrum Î²-lactamase producers and carbapenemase producing bacteria.  it was granted designation as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product and granted priority review status by the FDA on November 14, 2019. It is indicated for use in complicated urinary tract infections in patients with limited or no alternative treatments available. This indication was supported by a positive clinical trial composed of 448 patients with complicated urinary tract infections which demonstrated a 72.6% rate of symptom resolution and bacterial eradication with it compared to 54.6% with the comparator, imipenem/cilastatin. A concern noted in the trial was a 0.3% higher rate of all cause mortality, the cause of which has not been determined.
