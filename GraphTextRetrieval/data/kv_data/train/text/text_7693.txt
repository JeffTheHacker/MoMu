2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-Hexamethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane, also known as fema 3475 or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dithioketals. Dithioketals are compounds containing a dithioketal functional group with the general structure R2C(SR')2 with R, R' = organyl. 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-Hexamethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-hexamethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-Hexamethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane has a blackberry, burnt, and earthy taste.
