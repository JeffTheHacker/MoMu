it is an oxo monocarboxylic acid that consists of propionic acid substituted by a 3-benzoylphenyl group at position 2. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an antipyretic, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a member of benzophenones and an oxo monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a propionic acid. it is a propionic acid derivate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects. it inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in a decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, by prostaglandin synthase, is responsible for the therapeutic effects of ibuprofen. it also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
