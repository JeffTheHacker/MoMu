it, also known as fema 3359, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-methylbutyl 2-methylbutanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a sweet, apple, and berry tasting compound that can be found in fats and oils, fruits, roman camomile, and spearmint. This makes 2-methylbutyl 2-methylbutanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
