it is a yellow to light-orange crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a it in which all four exocyclic double bonds have E- (trans-) geometry. It has a role as a keratolytic drug, an antineoplastic agent, an antioxidant, a signalling molecule, a retinoid X receptor agonist, an anti-inflammatory agent, an AP-1 antagonist, a it receptor agonist and a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an all-trans-retinoate. it is a naturally-occurring acid of retinol. it binds to and activates it receptors (RARs), thereby inducing changes in gene expression that lead to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumorigenesis. This agent also inhibits telomerase, resulting in telomere shortening and eventual apoptosis of some tumor cell types. The oral form of it has teratogenic and embryotoxic properties.
