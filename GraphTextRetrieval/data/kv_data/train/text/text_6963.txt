it is a rebaudioside that is rubusoside in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 of the beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at the 13alpha position have both been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside. It has a role as a sweetening agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a tetracyclic diterpenoid and a rebaudioside. It derives from a rubusoside and a beta-D-Glcp-(1->2)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)]-beta-D-Glcp.
