it is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic having N(1)-methyltetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl, {[(cyanomethyl)sulfanyl]acetyl}amino and methoxy side-groups at positions 3, 7beta and 7alpha respectively of the parent cephem bicyclic structure. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a second-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
