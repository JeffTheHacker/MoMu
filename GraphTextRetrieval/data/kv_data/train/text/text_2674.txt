3, 4-Dihydro-6-methoxy-3, 7-dimethyl-1H-2-benzopyran-8-ol, also known as dhmi-8 or 3, 8-dihydroxy-1, 2, 4-trimethoxyxanthone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-benzopyrans. These are organic aromatic compounds that 1-benzopyran, a bicyclic compound made up of a benzene ring fused to a pyran, so that the oxygen atom is at the 2-position. 3, 4-Dihydro-6-methoxy-3, 7-dimethyl-1H-2-benzopyran-8-ol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3, 4-dihydro-6-methoxy-3, 7-dimethyl-1H-2-benzopyran-8-ol is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
