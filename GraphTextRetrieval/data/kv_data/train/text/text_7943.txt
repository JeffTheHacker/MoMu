it, also known as cornustannin 2 or eugeniin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydrolyzable tannins. These are tannins with a structure characterized by either of the following models. In model 1, the structure contains galloyl units (in some cases, shikimic acid units) that are linked to diverse polyol carbohydrate-, catechin-, or triterpenoid units. In model 2, contains at least two galloyl units C-C coupled to each other, and do not contain a glycosidically linked catechin unit. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, tellimagrandin ii can be found in a number of food items such as enokitake, rape, swiss chard, and swamp cabbage. This makes tellimagrandin ii a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
