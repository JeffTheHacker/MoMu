3-Phenylprop-2-enoic acid, also known as it or benzenepropenoic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cinnamic acids. These are organic aromatic compounds containing a benzene and a carboxylic acid group forming 3-phenylprop-2-enoic acid. 3-Phenylprop-2-enoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 3-Phenylprop-2-enoic acid is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, 2, 3-dihydroxycinnamic acid, 1-(3, 4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-2-propen-1-one, and acetic acid [2-[2-(1-oxo-3-phenylprop-2-enyl)-3-phenyl-3, 4-dihydropyrazol-5-yl]phenyl] ester.
