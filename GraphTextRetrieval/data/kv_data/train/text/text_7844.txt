it is prostaglandin F2alpha in which the hydroxy group at position 9 has been oxidised to the corresponding ketone. it is the most common and most biologically potent of mammalian prostaglandins. It has a role as an oxytocic, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a synthetic it (it) analogue with smooth muscle contraction inducing property. It has been suggested that it regulates the intracellular levels of cyclic 3, 5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by activating adenylate cyclase and thereby increases cellular membrane calcium ion transport. By acting directly on the myometrium, dinoprostone induces uterine and gastrointestinal smooth muscle contractions.
