2-Ethyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole, also known as 4, 5-dimethyl-2-ethylthiazole or 9-aminoacridine HCL H2O, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. 2-Ethyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-ethyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-Ethyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole is a burnt, cocoa, and hazelnut tasting compound that can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 2-ethyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
