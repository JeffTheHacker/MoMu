Octahydro-2, 5, 5, 8a-tetramethyl-7H-1-benzopyran-7-one, also known as 1, 3, 7, 7-tetramethyl-2-oxabicyclo[4. 4. 0]decan-9-one or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a pyran ring. Pyran a six-membered heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring, made up of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom and containing two double bonds. Octahydro-2, 5, 5, 8a-tetramethyl-7H-1-benzopyran-7-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, octahydro-2, 5, 5, 8a-tetramethyl-7H-1-benzopyran-7-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, octahydro-2, 5, 5, 8a-tetramethyl-7H-1-benzopyran-7-one can be found in fruits. This makes octahydro-2, 5, 5, 8a-tetramethyl-7H-1-benzopyran-7-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
