cis- And trans-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-1, 3-dioxolane, also known as iso-valeraldehyde propyleneglycol acetal 1 or 1, 3-dioxolane, 4-methyl-2-(2-methylpropyl), cis, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3-dioxolanes. These are organic compounds containing 1, 3-dioxolane, an aliphatic five-member ring with two oxygen atoms in ring positions 1 and 3. cis- And trans-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-1, 3-dioxolane is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, cis- and trans-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-1, 3-dioxolane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. cis- And trans-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-1, 3-dioxolane has a sweet, buttery, and dairy taste.
