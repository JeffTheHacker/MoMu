2, 6, 10, 10-Tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4. 5]decan-6-ol, also known as it or fema 3549, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrahydrofurans. These are heterocyclic compounds containing a saturated, aliphatic, five-membered ring where a carbon is replaced by an oxygen. 2, 6, 10, 10-Tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4. 5]decan-6-ol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 6, 10, 10-tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4. 5]decan-6-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 6, 10, 10-tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4. 5]decan-6-ol can be found in tea. This makes 2, 6, 10, 10-tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4. 5]decan-6-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
