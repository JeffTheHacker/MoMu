2-Ethoxy-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene, also known as 2-ethoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylbenzene or 5-[(1-thioxoethyl)amino]-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. 2-Ethoxy-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-ethoxy-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 2-Ethoxy-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene has a carrot, herbal, and spicy taste.
