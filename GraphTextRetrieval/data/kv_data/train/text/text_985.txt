17beta-hydroxy-17-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-3-one is a synthetic non-aromatisable androgen and anabolic steroid. It binds strongly to the androgen receptor and has therefore also been used as an affinity label for this receptor in the prostate and in prostatic tumors. It has a role as an androgen. It is an anabolic androgenic steroid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid and a 3-oxo steroid. It derives from a hydride of an estrane.
