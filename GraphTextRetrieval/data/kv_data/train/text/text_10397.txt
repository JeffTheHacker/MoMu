Droxidopa, also known as dops or northera, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tyrosine and derivatives. Tyrosine and derivatives are compounds containing tyrosine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of tyrosine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. Droxidopa is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Droxidopa has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood.
