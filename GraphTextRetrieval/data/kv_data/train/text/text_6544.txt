it is a flurbiprofen. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-flurbiprofen. it is an orally active synthetic enantiomer of flurbiprofen. it activates c-Jun N terminal kinase, increases AP-1 binding to DNA, and downregulates cyclin D1 expression, resulting in arrest of tumor cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis. This agent also affects the expression of nuclear factor kappa B, a rapid response transcription factor that stimulates the immune response to tumor cells. it does not inhibit the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase.
