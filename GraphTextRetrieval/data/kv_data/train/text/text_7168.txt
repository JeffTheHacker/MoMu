it is a piperidinemonocarboxylic acid that is 4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom is substituted by a 3-cyano-3,3-diphenylpropyl group. It has a role as an antidiarrhoeal drug. It is a piperidinemonocarboxylic acid, a tertiary amine and a nitrile. it is a phenylpiperidine with antidiarrheal activity and an active metabolite of diphenoxylate. it is chemically related to the narcotic opioid meperidine. it acts primarily on the gastrointestinal wall by binding to opioid receptors on acetylcholine-containing nerves and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals. This leads to a reduction in intestinal motility. it hydrochloride also mimics the action of endogenous opioid peptides at the CNS opioid receptors, (primarily mu-receptors), thereby inducing CNS effects.
