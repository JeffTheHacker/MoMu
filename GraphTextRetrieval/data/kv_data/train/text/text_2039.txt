it is a benzoate ester in which 4-N-butylbenzoic acid and 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol have combined to form the ester bond; a local ester anaesthetic (ester caine) used for surface and spinal anaesthesia. It has a role as a local anaesthetic. It is a benzoate ester and a tertiary amino compound. it is a benzoate ester with anesthetic properties. Upon administration, it reversibly binds voltage-gated sodium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes and inhibits sodium influx. This prevents the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses, and stabilizes neuronal membranes. This results in a loss of sensation, and thereby provides analgesia and anesthesia.
