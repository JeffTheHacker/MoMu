(+)-alpha-Muurolene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units (+)-alpha-Muurolene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule (+)-alpha-Muurolene has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, (+)-alpha-muurolene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
