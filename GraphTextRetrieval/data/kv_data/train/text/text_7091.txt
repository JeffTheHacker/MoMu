it is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 6-aminonicotinic acid with ammonia. An inhibitor of the NADP(+)-dependent enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, it interferes with glycolysis, resulting in ATP depletion and synergizes with DNA-crosslinking chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, in killing cancer cells. It has a role as a teratogenic agent, an antimetabolite and an EC 1.1.1.44 (NADP(+)-dependent decarboxylating phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. It is an aminopyridine, a primary amino compound and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a 6-aminonicotinic acid.
