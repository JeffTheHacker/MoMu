it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1-methyl-1H-benzimidazole which is substituted at positions 4, 5, and 6 by fluorine, (4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl)amino, and N-(2-hydroxyethoxy)aminocarbonyl groups, respectively. It is a MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a hydroxamic acid ester, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of bromobenzenes, an organofluorine compound and a secondary amino compound. it is an orally active, small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. it is an ATP-independent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAPK/ERK kinase) 1 and 2. MEK 1 and 2 are dual specificity kinases that are essential mediators in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, are often upregulated in various cancer cells, and are drivers of diverse cellular responses, including proliferation. Inhibition of both MEK1 and 2 by it prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, thereby leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in various cancers.
