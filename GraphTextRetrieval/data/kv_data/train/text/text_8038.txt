2, 3-Dimethylthiophene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. 2, 3-Dimethylthiophene exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 3-dimethylthiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 3-dimethylthiophene can be found in garden onion. This makes 2, 3-dimethylthiophene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
