2, 3-Epoxysesamone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as vitamin k compounds. These are quinone lipids containing a methylated naphthoquinone ring structure, and vary in the aliphatic side chain attached at the 3-position. 2, 3-Epoxysesamone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3-epoxysesamone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 3-epoxysesamone can be found in fats and oils. This makes 2, 3-epoxysesamone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
