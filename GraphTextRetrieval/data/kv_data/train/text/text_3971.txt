Fluvoxamine, also known as floxyfral or novo-fluvoxamine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trifluoromethylbenzenes. These are organofluorine compounds that contain a benzene ring substituted with one or more trifluoromethyl groups. Fluvoxamine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Fluvoxamine has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, fluvoxamine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Fluvoxamine is a potentially toxic compound.
