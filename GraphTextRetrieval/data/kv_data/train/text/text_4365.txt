it is a microcystin consisting of D-alanyl, L-leucyl, (3S)-3-methyl-D-beta-aspartyl, L-tryptophanyl, (2S,3S,4E,6E,8S,9S)-3-amino-4,5,6,7-tetradehydro-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldecanoyl, D-gamma-glutamyl, and 2,3-didehydro-N-methylalanyl residues joined into a 25-membered macrocycle. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic.
