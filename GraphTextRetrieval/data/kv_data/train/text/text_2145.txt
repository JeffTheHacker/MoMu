it has been used in trials studying the treatment of RSV Infection, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infections. it is an orally available inhibitor of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein (F protein), with potential antiviral activity. Upon oral administration of GS-5806, this agent specifically binds to F protein on the viral surface, which inhibits RSV F protein-mediated fusion with the host cell membrane and prevents viral entry. This blocks RSV replication, reduces viral load, and decreases the severity of the disease. RSV F protein, a viral surface glycoprotein, plays a key role in RSV fusion with and entry into target cells.
