it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as primary carboxylic acid amides. Primary carboxylic acid amides are compounds comprising primary carboxylic acid amide functional group, with the general structure RC(=O)NH2. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty amide lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in mushrooms. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
