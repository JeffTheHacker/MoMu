it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, esculentic acid (diplazium) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, esculentic acid (diplazium) can be found in green vegetables. This makes esculentic acid (diplazium) a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
