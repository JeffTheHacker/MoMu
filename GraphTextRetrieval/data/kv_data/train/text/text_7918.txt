it is 2'-Deoxyadenosine in which the hydrogen at position 2 on the purine ring has been substituted by chlorine. It inhibits the synthesis and repair of DNA, particularly in lymphocytes and monocytes, and is used as an antimetabolite antineoplastic drug for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies including hairy-cell leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an immunosuppressive agent. It is a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside and an organochlorine compound. it is a purine nucleoside antimetabolite analogue. it triphosphate, a phosphorylated metabolite of it, incorporates into DNA, resulting in single-strand breaks in DNA, depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and apoptosis. Because this agent is resistant to adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that inactivates some antineoplastic agents, it is selectively toxic to lymphocytes and monocytes which exhibit little deoxynucleotide deaminase activity.
