it trihydrate is an odorless white microcrystalline powder with a bitter taste. A 0.25% solution in water has a pH of 3.5 to 5.5. (NTP, 1992) it is a penicillin in which the substituent at position 6 of the penam ring is a 2-amino-2-phenylacetamido group. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a penicillin, a penicillin allergen and a beta-lactam antibiotic. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is a broad-spectrum, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam penicillin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. it is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, therefore, can be used in wide range of gram-positive and -negative infections.
