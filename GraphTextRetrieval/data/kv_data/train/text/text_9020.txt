1-acetyl-4-(4-{[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy}phenyl)piperazine is a dioxolane that is 1,3-dioxolane which is substituted at positions 2, 2, and 4 by imidazol-1-ylmethyl, 2,4-dichlorophenyl, and [para-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenoxy]methyl groups, respectively. It is an ether, a member of imidazoles, a N-arylpiperazine, a dioxolane, a dichlorobenzene and a N-acylpiperazine. it is a synthetic derivative of phenylpiperazine with broad antifungal properties and potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits sterol 14-a-dimethylase, a microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, thereby disrupting synthesis of ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell wall.
