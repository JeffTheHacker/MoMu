1-{2-(4-chlorobenzyloxy)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl}imidazole is a member of the class of imidazoles that is 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(imidazol-1-yl)ethanol in which the hydroxyl hydrogen is replaced by a 4-chlorobenzyl group. It is an ether, a member of imidazoles, a dichlorobenzene and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is an imidazole with antifungal property. it compromises the integrity of fungal cell wall through inhibiting 14-alpha demethylase, which catalyzes conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. As a result, this agent increases cellular permeability thereby resulting in leakage of cellular contents. Furthermore, it has also been implicated to inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis.
