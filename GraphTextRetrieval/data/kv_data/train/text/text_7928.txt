it is a vasopeptidase inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it exerts its effect by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). ACE inhibition results in inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system thereby leading to the reduction of vasoconstriction. Inhibition of NEP leads to the inhibition of hydrolyzation of a number of endogenous vasoactive peptides, such as bradykinin and substance P and as NEP is the principal enzyme degrading natriuretic peptides, NEP inhibition also results in an increase in natriuretic peptidase circulation. Ultimately both effects result in blood vessel relaxation.
