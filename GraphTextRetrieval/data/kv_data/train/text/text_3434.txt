it, also known as 6-N-tridecylsalicylic acid or 6-tridecyl phenol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as salicylic acids. These are ortho-hydroxylated benzoic acids. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-hydroxy-6-tridecylbenzoic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2-hydroxy-6-tridecylbenzoic acid can be found in fats and oils and nuts. This makes 2-hydroxy-6-tridecylbenzoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
