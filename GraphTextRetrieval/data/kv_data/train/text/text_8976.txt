it, also known as N-phenyl-succinamic acid or succinanilate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anilides. These are organic heterocyclic compounds derived from oxoacids RkE(=O)l(OH)m (l not 0) by replacing an OH group by the NHPh group or derivative formed by ring substitution. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 4-anilino-4-oxobutanoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
