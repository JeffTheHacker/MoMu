it, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthofurans. Naphthofurans are compounds containing a furan ring fused to a naphthalene moiety. Furan is a 5 membered- ring aromatic ring with four carbon and one oxygen atoms. Naphthalene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made up of two fused benzene rings. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ambronide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it has a sweet, ambergris, and dry taste.
