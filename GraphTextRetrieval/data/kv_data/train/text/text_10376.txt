it is a member of 1,3,5-triazines and a monocarboxylic acid. it is a modulator of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activity and inhibitor of the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase (OPRT), with chemoprotective activity. it preferentially localizes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where it inhibits OPRT, thereby decreasing metabolism of 5-FU into its active metabolite 5-fluorouridine-5'-monophosphate (FUMP). This decreases activated 5-FU-related gastrointestinal toxicity.
