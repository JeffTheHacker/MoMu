ADP-Glucose, also known as adpg or ADP glucose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purine nucleotide sugars. These are purine nucleotides bound to a saccharide derivative through the terminal phosphate group. ADP-Glucose is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, ADP-glucose is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
