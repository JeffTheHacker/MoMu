4-Coumaroyl-CoA belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-enoyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to a 2-enoyl chain. Thus, 4-coumaroyl-CoA is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. 4-Coumaroyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 4-Coumaroyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 4-coumaroyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 4-Coumaroyl-CoA exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
