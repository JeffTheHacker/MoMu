The combination of ticarcillin and clavulanate provides an extended-spectrum penicillin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor and is used to treat serious bacterial infections due to susceptible organisms. Given parenterally, ticarcillin-clavulanate can cause mild transient aminotransferase elevations, and therapy has been linked to instances of acute cholestatic liver disease similar to that described commonly with amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin).
