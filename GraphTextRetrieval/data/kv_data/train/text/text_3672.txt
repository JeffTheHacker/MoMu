it is the 1-hydrazino derivative of phthalazine; a direct-acting vasodilator that is used as an antihypertensive agent. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and a vasodilator agent. It is a member of phthalazines, an azaarene, an ortho-fused heteroarene and a member of hydrazines. it is a phthalazine derivative with antihypertensive effects. it exerts its vasodilatory effects through modification of the contractile state of arterial vascular smooth muscle by altering intracellular calcium release, and interfering with smooth muscle cell calcium influx. This agent also causes inhibition of phosphorylation of myosin protein or chelation of trace metals required for smooth muscle contraction, thereby resulting in an increase in heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output.
