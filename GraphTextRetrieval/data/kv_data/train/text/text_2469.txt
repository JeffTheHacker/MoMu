it, or BM 21.0955, is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate similar to [zoledronic acid], [minodronic acid], and [risedronic acid]. It is used to prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. it was first described in the literature in 1993 as a treatment for bone loss in dogs.  it was granted FDA approval on 16 May 2003. it is a third-generation amino-bisphosphonate with anti-resorptive and anti-hypercalcemic activities. it binds to and adsorbs onto the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, thereby preventing osteoclast resorption. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the formation of isoprenoids, thereby leading to a reduction in the farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of signaling proteins of G protein-coupled signaling, and, eventually, inducing apoptosis of osteoclasts. By inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, it increases bone mineral density, decreases bone remodeling and turnover, as well as reduces bone pain.
