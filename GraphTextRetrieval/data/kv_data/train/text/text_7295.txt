it is an alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acid that is heptane substituted at positions 1 and 7 by carboxy groups. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, an antineoplastic agent, a dermatologic drug and a plant metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an azelaate(2-) and an azelaate. it is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid produced by Malassezia furfur and found in whole grain cereals, rye, barley and animal products. it possesses antibacterial, keratolytic, comedolytic, and anti-oxidant activity. it is bactericidal against Proprionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis due to its inhibitory effect on the synthesis of microbial cellular proteins. it exerts its keratolytic and comedolytic effects by reducing the thickness of the stratum corneum and decreasing the number of keratohyalin granules by reducing the amount and distribution of filaggrin in epidermal layers. it also possesses a direct anti-inflammatory effect due to its scavenger activity of free oxygen radical. This drug is used topically to reduce inflammation associated with acne and rosacea.
