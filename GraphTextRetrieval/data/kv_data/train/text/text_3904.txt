Procaine benzylpenicillin (INN), also known as procaine G penicillin, is an injectable antiobiotic. It is a poorly soluble salt form of penicillin which is a combination of naturally occuring benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) and the local anaesthetic agent procaine in equimolar amounts. Procaine benzylpenicillin is administered by deep intramuscular injection. It is slowly absorbed and hydrolyzed to benzylpenicillin. This drug is used where prolonged exposure to benzylpenicillin at a low concentration is required. This combination is aimed at reducing the pain and discomfort associated with a large intramuscular injection of penicillin. It is widely used in veterinary settings. Benzylpenicillin is active against a wide range of organisms and is the drug of first choice for many infections.
