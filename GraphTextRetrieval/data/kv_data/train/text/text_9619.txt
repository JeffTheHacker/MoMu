it is a member of the class of piperidines that is L-tyrosine in which a hydrogen attached to the amino group is replaced by a butylsulfonyl group and in which the hydrogen attached to the phenolic hydroxy group is replaced by a 4-(piperidin-4-yl)butyl group. It has a role as a fibrin modulating drug, a platelet glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist and an anticoagulant. It is a member of piperidines, a sulfonamide and a L-tyrosine derivative. it is a non-peptide tyrosine derivative, with anticoagulant activity. Upon administration, it antagonizes fibrinogen binding to the platelet cell surface receptor, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIA complex, one of the two purinergic receptors activated by ADP. This prevents the GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. This results in decreased levels of cAMP, interferes with the platelet membrane function and subsequent platelet-platelet interaction, prevents the release of platelet granule constituents and prolongs bleeding time.
