4, 8, 12, 15, 19-Docosapentaenoic acid, also known as clupadonic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as very long-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains at least 22 carbon atoms. 4, 8, 12, 15, 19-Docosapentaenoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 4, 8, 12, 15, 19-Docosapentaenoic acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 4, 8, 12, 15, 19-docosapentaenoic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), cytoplasm and adiposome. Outside of the human body, 4, 8, 12, 15, 19-docosapentaenoic acid can be found in fats and oils and fishes. This makes 4, 8, 12, 15, 19-docosapentaenoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
