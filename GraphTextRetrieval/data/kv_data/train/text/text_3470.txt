it, stabilized appears as a clear colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Flash point 12Â°F. Less dense than water. Flammable over a wide range of vapor-air concentrations. Vapors irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. May be toxic by prolonged inhalation, skin absorption, or ingestion. Carcinogenic. Vapors heavier than air. May polymerize exothermically if heated or contaminated. If the polymerization takes place inside a container, the container may rupture violently. it is a saturated organic heteromonocyclic parent, a member of its and an azacycloalkane. It has a role as an alkylating agent. It is a conjugate base of an aziridinium. it is a monofunctional alkylating agent with potential antineoplastic activity. Reacting with DNA mainly at guanine and adenine residues, it alkylates DNA, thereby producing DNA interstrand crosslinks and DNA breaks, and interfering with DNA replication and cell division.
