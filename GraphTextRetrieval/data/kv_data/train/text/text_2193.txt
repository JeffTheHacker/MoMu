Carbon C-14 is an unstable isotope of carbon created when a neutron collides with a nitrogen atom, causing capture of the neutron and release of the proton converting nitrogen to a carbon with fourteen nucleons (6 protons and 8 neutrons). it emits beta particles as it decays and reverts back to nitrogen.
