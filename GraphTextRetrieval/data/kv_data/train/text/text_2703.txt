it is an odorless canary yellow to yellow-orange crystalline powder. Bitter taste. (NTP, 1992) it is a thioxanthen-9-one compound having a hydroxymethyl substituent at the 1-position and a 2-[(diethylamino)ethyl]amino substituent at the 4-position. It was formerly used (particularly as the monomethanesulfonic acid salt) as a schistosomicide for individual or mass treatement of infection with Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni, but due to its toxicity and concern about possible carcinogenicity, it has been replaced by other drugs such as praziquantel. It has a role as a schistosomicide drug and a mutagen. It derives from a lucanthone. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a thioxanthene derivative of lucanthone with anti-schistosomal activity and potential antineoplastic activity. it interferes with parasite nerve function, resulting in parasite paralysis and death. This agent also intercalates into DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis in vitro. (NCI04)
