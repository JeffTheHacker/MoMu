it is a monocarboxylic acid comprising 1,8-naphthyridin-4-one substituted by carboxylic acid, ethyl and methyl groups at positions 3, 1, and 7, respectively. An orally administered antibacterial, it is used in the treatment of lower urinary-tract infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, including the majority of E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus species. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, a DNA synthesis inhibitor and an antimicrobial agent. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a 1,8-naphthyridine derivative and a quinolone antibiotic. It is a conjugate acid of a it anion. it is a synthetic quinolone and antibacterial agent with urinary tract antiseptic activity. it concentrates in the renal tubules and bladder and exerts its local antibacterial actions by interference of DNA gyrase activity, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis during bacterial replication in a dose-dependent manner. it is active against most gram-negative organisms that cause urinary tract infections.
