4-Methylacetophenone, also known as melilot or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. 4-Methylacetophenone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 4-methylacetophenone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 4-Methylacetophenone exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. 4-Methylacetophenone is a sweet, acetophenone, and bitter almond tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as parsley, green vegetables, herbs and spices, and pepper (c. frutescens). This makes 4-methylacetophenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
