it, also known as ethyl (methylsulfanyl)acetate or fema 3835, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carboxylic acid esters. These are carboxylic acid derivatives in which the carbon atom from the carbonyl group is attached to an alkyl or an aryl moiety through an oxygen atom (forming an ester group). it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is an apricot, citrus, and earthy tasting compound that can be found in fruits and muskmelon. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
