it is a member of the class of quinazolines that is quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione which is substituted at position 3 by a 2-[4-(p-fluorobenzoyl)piperidin-1-yl]ethyl group. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, an antihypertensive agent, a cardiovascular drug and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is a member of quinazolines, a member of piperidines, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ketone. it is a quinazoline derivative and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptor subtype 2 (5-HTR2) antagonist with potential antihypertensive and antiplatelet activities. Following administration, it binds to and inhibits the signaling mediated by 5-HTR2, which inhibits serotonin-dependent vasoconstriction and platelet activation.
