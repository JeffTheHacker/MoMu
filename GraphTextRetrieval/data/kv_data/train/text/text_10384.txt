Peplomycin Sulfate is the sulfate salt of the bleomycin analogue peplomycin. Peplomycin forms complexes with iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals that cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA. This agent appears to show greater antitumor activity than bleomycin; its use is limited due to pulmonary toxicity. (NCI04)
