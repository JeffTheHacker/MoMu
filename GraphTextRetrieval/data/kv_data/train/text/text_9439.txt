it, also known as amygdaloside or laetrile, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyanogenic glycosides. These are glycosides in which the aglycone moiety contains a cyanide group. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, amygdalin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, amygdalin can be found in a number of food items such as passion fruit, lima bean, peach, and common chokecherry. This makes amygdalin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. it is a cyanogenic glucoside isolated from almonds and seeds of other plants of the family Rosaceae. it is converted by plant emulsin (a combination of a glucosidase and a nitrilase) or hydrochloric acid into benzaldehyde, D-glucose, and hydrocyanic acid.
