These are organic compounds containing a benzene fused to an oxazole ring (a five-member aliphatic ring with three carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and one nitrogen atom) bearing a ketone group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
