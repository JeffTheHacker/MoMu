Ubiquinones is any benzoquinone derived from 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone; one of a group of naturally occurring homologues. The redox-active quinoid moiety usually carries a polyprenoid side chain at position 6, the number of isoprenoid units in which is species-specific. Ubiquinones are involved in the control of mitochondrial electron transport, and are also potent anti-oxidants. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a prenylquinone and a member of 1,4-benzoquinones. It derives from a 2,3-dihydroxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone.
