it is an optically active form of it having L-configuration. It has a role as an EC 1.3.1.43 (arogenate dehydrogenase) inhibitor, a nutraceutical, a micronutrient and a fundamental metabolite. It is an erythrose 4-phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a it and a L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a L-tyrosinal. It is a conjugate base of a L-tyrosinium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-tyrosinate(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is the levorotatory isomer of the aromatic amino acid it. it is a naturally occurring it and is synthesized in vivo from L-phenylalanine. It is considered a non-essential amino acid; however, in patients with phenylketonuria who lack phenylalanine hydroxylase and cannot convert phenylalanine into it, it is considered an essential nutrient. In vivo, it plays a role in protein synthesis and serves as a precursor for the synthesis of catecholamines, thyroxine, and melanin.
