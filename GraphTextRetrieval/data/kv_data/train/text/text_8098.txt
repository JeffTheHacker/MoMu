it is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic pro-drug. it is converted by hydrolysis during intestinal absorption into the microbiologically active erythromycylamine. Eryhtromylamine binds to the 50 S subunit of the 70 S ribosome of susceptible organisms, thereby inhibiting bacterial RNA-dependent protein synthesis. This antibiotic is used in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including S. aureus, S. pneumonia and pyogenes, gram-negative microorganisms, including H. influenzae, L. pneumophila, M. catarrhalis, and M. pneumoniae.
