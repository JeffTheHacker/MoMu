2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxy-3, 5-diiodophenyl)propanoic acid, also known as it or Diiodotyrosine, is classified as a tyrosine or a derivative. A tyrosine or a derivative are compounds containing tyrosine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of tyrosine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. 2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxy-3, 5-diiodophenyl)propanoic acid is considered a practically insoluble (in water), acidic compound. A product from the iodination of MONOIODOTYROSINE. In the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, diiodotyrosine residues are coupled with other monoiodotyrosine or diiodotyrosine residues to form T4 or T3 thyroid hormones (THYROXINE and TRIIODOTHYRONINE).
