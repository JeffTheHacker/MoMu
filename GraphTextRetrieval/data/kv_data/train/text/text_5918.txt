it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acyl glycosides of mono- and disaccharides. Fatty acyl glycosides of mono- and disaccharides are compounds composed of a mono- or disaccharide moiety linked to one hydroxyl group of a fatty alcohol or of a phosphorylated alcohol (phosphoprenols), a hydroxy fatty acid or to one carboxyl group of a fatty acid (ester linkage) or to an amino alcohol. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
