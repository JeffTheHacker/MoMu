2-Hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid, also known as 4-tfmsa or HTB, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as salicylic acids. These are ortho-hydroxylated benzoic acids. 2-Hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). 2-Hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
