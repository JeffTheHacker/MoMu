Pyrrolidino-[1, 2E]-4H-2, 4-dimethyl-1, 3, 5-dithiazine, also known as pyrrolidino[1, 2-e]-4h-1, 3, 5-dithiazine, 2, 4-dimethyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3, 5-dithiazinanes. These are cyclic compounds that contain a dithiazinane ring, which is a saturated heterocycle that consisting of one nitrogen atom, two sulfur atoms at the 1-, 3-, and 5- position, respectively. Pyrrolidino-[1, 2E]-4H-2, 4-dimethyl-1, 3, 5-dithiazine is slightly soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, pyrrolidino-[1, 2E]-4H-2, 4-dimethyl-1, 3, 5-dithiazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Pyrrolidino-[1, 2E]-4H-2, 4-dimethyl-1, 3, 5-dithiazine has a cooked, meaty, and roasted taste.
