it is the actetate salt form of chlormadinone, a synthetic progestin with antiandrogenic and antigonadotropic effects. it (CMA) is a potent progesterone receptor (PR) agonist, a partial androgen receptor (AR) antagonist and a weak glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. Chlormadinone binds to PRs, which induces the expression of progesterone-responsive genes. In addition, chlormadinone blocks ARs in target organs and reduces the activity of skin 5 alpha-reductase; thus inhibiting androgen production and signaling. Through the negative feedback action on the hypothalamus-pituitary system, chlormadinone also suppresses gonadotropin secretion, which prevents ovarian and adrenal androgen production. Therefore, this agent decreases endometrial thickness, increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, inhibits ovulation and suppresses follicular growth and maturation.
