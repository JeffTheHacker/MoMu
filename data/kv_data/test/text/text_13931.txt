it is a 1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine with a carboxy group at the 3-position, an oxo sustituent at the 4-position, a fluoro substituent at the 5-position and a substituted pyrrolin-1-yl group at the 7-position. It has a role as a topoisomerase IV inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent and an antibacterial drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a 1,8-naphthyridine derivative, a quinolone antibiotic and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. it Mesylate is the mesylate salt form of it, a synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity. it mesylate inhibits activities of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and eventually bacterial growth. This fluoroquinolone exerts an enhanced spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to its activity against gram-negative bacteria. it is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with antimicrobial property. it enters bacterial cells by diffusion through integral membrane porin pathway before targeting both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two enzymes critical for DNA replication and repair. This agent binds to the DNA/DNA-gyrase complex and inhibits the A subunits of the enzyme thereby preventing the bacterial chromosome from rejoining. This interferes with DNA replication and repair processes as well as transcription, and ultimately leads to bacterial cell death. it targets at both Gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens.
