it, also known as azt glucuronide or gazt, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrimidine 2', 3'-dideoxyribonucleosides. Pyrimidine 2', 3'-dideoxyribonucleosides are compounds consisting of a pyrimidine linked to a ribose which lacks a hydroxyl group at positions 2 and 3. it is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'- O-beta-D-glucopyranuronosylthymidine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
