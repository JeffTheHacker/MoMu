Isopentenyl acetate, also known as dimethylallyl acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carboxylic acid esters. These are carboxylic acid derivatives in which the carbon atom from the carbonyl group is attached to an alkyl or an aryl moiety through an oxygen atom (forming an ester group). Isopentenyl acetate is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, isopentenyl acetate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Isopentenyl acetate is a sweet, balsam, and banana tasting compound that can be found in fats and oils. This makes isopentenyl acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
