17beta-estradiol 3-benzoate is a benzoate ester resulting from the formal condensation of benzoic acid with the phenolic hydroxy group of 17beta-estradiol. It has a role as a xenoestrogen and an estrogen receptor agonist. It is a benzoate ester and a 17beta-hydroxy steroid. It derives from a 17beta-estradiol. it is the synthetic benzoate ester of estradiol, a steroid sex hormone vital to the maintenance of fertility and secondary sexual characteristics in females.
