it is a glycine derivative that is the amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-(2,5-dichlorobenzoyl)glycine with the amino group of 2,2'-{2-[(1R)-1-amino-3-methylbutyl]-5-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-4,4-diyl}diacetic acid. A prodrug for ixazomib that is used in combination therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma. It has a role as a prodrug, a proteasome inhibitor, an orphan drug, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a glycine derivative, a member of benzamides, a dichlorobenzene, an oxo dicarboxylic acid and a 1,3,2-dioxaborolane. It derives from an ixazomib. it is the citrate salt form of ixazomib, an orally bioavailable second generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) with potential antineoplastic activity. Ixazomib inhibits the activity of the proteasome, blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, which results in an accumulation of unwanted or misfolded proteins; disruption of various cell signaling pathways may follow, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Compared to first generation PIs, second generation PIs may have an improved pharmacokinetic profile with increased potency and less toxicity. Proteasomes are large protease complexes that degrade unneeded or damaged proteins that have been ubiquinated.
