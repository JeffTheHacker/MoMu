it is a methanesulfonate ester resulting from the formal condensation of methanesulfonic acid with methanol. It has a role as an alkylating agent, a genotoxin, a carcinogenic agent, a mutagen and an apoptosis inducer. it is a stable, colorless, combustible liquid that emits toxic fumes of sulfoxide when heated to decomposition. it is used for laboratory purposes as a catalyst in chemical synthesis and has been tested clinically as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. This substance is an alkylating agent and acts as a mutagen by altering and damaging DNA and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
