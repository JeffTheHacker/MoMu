it is an N,N-disubstituted benzenesulfonamide bearing an unsubstituted amino group at the 4-position, used for the treatment of HIV infection. A second-generation HIV protease inhibitor, it was designed to form robust interactions with the protease enzyme from many strains of HIV, including those from treatment-experienced patients with multiple resistance mutations to other protease inhibitors. It has a role as a HIV protease inhibitor and an antiviral drug. It is a furofuran, a carbamate ester and a sulfonamide. it is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease nonpeptidic inhibitor, with activity against HIV. Upon oral administration, it selectively targets and binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease, and inhibits the dimerization and catalytic activity of HIV-1 protease. This inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-infected cells. This inhibition leads to the production of immature, non-infectious viral proteins that are unable to form mature virions, and prevents HIV replication.
