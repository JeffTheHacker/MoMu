ite is a synthetic broad-spectrum fluorinated triazole with potential antifungal activity. ite preferentially inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Enzyme inhibition by this agent leads to a decrease in ergosterol pool that distresses synthesis of fungal cell membrane, thereby increases cell membrane permeability, and promotes loss of essential intracellular elements. This ultimately causes fungal cell lysis and death.
