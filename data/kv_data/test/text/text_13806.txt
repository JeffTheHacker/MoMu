it appears as solid odorless white crystals or pellets. Density 1.335 g /cc. Noncombustible. it is a carbonyl group with two C-bound amine groups. It has a role as a flour treatment agent, a human metabolite, a Daphnia magna metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a fertilizer. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide and a one-carbon compound. It derives from a carbonic acid. It is a tautomer of a carbamimidic acid. it is a nitrogenous compound containing a carbonyl group attached to two amine groups with osmotic diuretic activity. In vivo, it is formed in the liver via the it cycle from ammonia and is the final end product of protein metabolism. Administration of it elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eye, into interstitial fluid and plasma, thereby decreasing pressure in those tissues and increasing urine outflow.
