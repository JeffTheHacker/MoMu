Di-2-furanylmethane, also known as 2, 2'-methylene difuran or 2, 2'-difurylmethane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. Di-2-furanylmethane exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, di-2-furanylmethane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, di-2-furanylmethane can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes di-2-furanylmethane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
