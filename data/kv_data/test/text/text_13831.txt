it is a desoxynojirimycin derivative and inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase with antihyperglycemic activity. it binds to and inhibits alpha-glucosidase, an enteric enzyme found in the brush border of the small intestines that hydrolyzes oligosaccharides and disaccharides into glucose and other monosaccharides. This prevents the breakdown of larger carbohydrates into glucose and decreases the rise in postprandial blood glucose levels. Compared to acarbose, it is systemically absorbed.
