it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 7-o-methylisoflavones. These are isoflavones with methoxy groups attached to the C7 atom of the isoflavone backbone. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
