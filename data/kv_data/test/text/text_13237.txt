it is a biphenylyltetrazole where a 1,1'-biphenyl group is attached at the 5-position and has an additional trisubstituted imidazol-1-ylmethyl group at the 4'-position It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an endothelin receptor antagonist and an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a biphenylyltetrazole and a member of imidazoles. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a non-peptide angiotensin II antagonist with antihypertensive activity. Upon administration, it and its active metabolite selectively and competitively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin I (AT1) receptor. This blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting actions of angiotensin II, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Angiotensin II, formed from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete aldosterone, which decreases the excretion of sodium and increases the excretion of potassium. Angiotensin II also acts as a vasoconstrictor in vascular smooth muscle.
