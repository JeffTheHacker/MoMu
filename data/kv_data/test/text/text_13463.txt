it is a monoatomic trication and a lanthanum molecular entity. It has a role as a cofactor. Lanthanum Cation (3) is the ionized form of lanthanum (trivalent ion) with phosphate binding property. Lanthanum ion binds dietary phosphate and inhibits the absorption of phosphate by forming highly insoluble lanthanum-phosphate complexes that reduce the concentrations of serum phosphate and calcium phosphate.
