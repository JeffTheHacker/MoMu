it, also known as 2-keto-N-caprylate or 2-oxooctanoate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain keto acids and derivatives. These are keto acids with a 6 to 12 carbon atoms long side chain. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-keto-N-caprylic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
