Acarbose, also known as bay g 5421 or glumida, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminocyclitol glycosides. These are organic compounds containing an amicocyclitol moiety glycosidically linked to a carbohydrate moiety. There are two major classes of aminoglycosides containing a 2-streptamine core. They are called 4, 5- and 4, 6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamines. Acarbose is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Acarbose has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, acarbose is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Acarbose is a pseudotetrasaccharide and inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic alpha-amylase with antihyperglycemic activity. Acarbose binds to and inhibits alpha-glucosidase, an enteric enzyme found in the brush border of the small intestines that hydrolyzes oligosaccharides and disaccharides into glucose and other monosaccharides. This prevents the breakdown of larger carbohydrates into glucose and decreases the rise in postprandial blood glucose levels. In addition, acarbose inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase which hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the small intestines.
