it is a monocarboxylic acid amide. It has a role as an antiglaucoma drug and an antihypertensive agent. it is a synthetic prostamide and structural prostaglandin analogue with ocular hypotensive activity. it mimics the effects of the endogenous prostamides and reduces intraocular pressure by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the pressure-sensitive outflow pathway (the trabecular meshwork), and the pressure-insensitive outflow pathway (the uveoscleral routes). It is not clear whether it lowers intraocular pressure by stimulating F-Prostanoid receptors or by acting on specific prostamide receptors.
