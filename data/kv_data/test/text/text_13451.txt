it is a member of the class of isoquinolines that is (3S)-2-L-alanyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid in which the alpha-amino group of the alanyl residue has been substituted by a 1-ethoxycarbonyl-4-phenylbutan-2-yl group (the all-S isomer). A prodrug for itat (by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester to the corresponding carboxylic acid), it is used as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) used (generally as the hydrochloride salt) for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor, a prodrug and an antihypertensive agent. It is a member of isoquinolines, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, an ethyl ester and a tertiary carboxamide. it is a prodrug and non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it is hydrolized into its active form itat, which binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This abolishes the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. it also causes a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis, and increases bradykinin levels.
