Talbutal belongs to the class of organic compounds known as barbituric acid derivatives. Barbituric acid derivatives are compounds containing a perhydropyrimidine ring substituted at C-2, -4 and -6 by oxo groups. Talbutal exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Talbutal has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood.
