Phenylethyl acetate, also known as it or fema 2684, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group. Phenylethyl acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, phenylethyl acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Phenylethyl acetate exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Phenylethyl acetate is a gardenia, green, and leafy tasting compound that can be found in cloves. This makes phenylethyl acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
