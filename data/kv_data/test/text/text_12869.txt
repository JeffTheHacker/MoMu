it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a sweetish odor. Density 18.1 lb /gal. Slightly soluble in water. Soluble in most organic solvents and thinners. Noncombustible. Very toxic by inhalation, skin absorption or ingestion. Used as a solvent, scavenger for lead in gasoline, grain fumigant and in the manufacture of other chemicals. it is a bromoalkane that is ethane carrying bromo substituents at positions 1 and 2. It is produced by marine algae. It has a role as a fumigant, a carcinogenic agent, a marine metabolite, an algal metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a mutagen. It is a bromohydrocarbon and a bromoalkane. Ethylene Dibromide is a clear, colorless, volatile liquid brominated hydrocarbon with a mild, sweet, chloroform-like odor that emits corrosive and toxic fumes when heated to decomposition. it is used as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of resins, waxes, gums, dyes and pharmaceuticals and is used to produce vinyl bromide. Exposure to ethylene dibromide severely irritates the skin and causes depression and collapse. it affects DNA integrity by alkylation and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
