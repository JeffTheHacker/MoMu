Xi-4, 5-dihydro-2, 4(5)-dimethyl-1H-imidazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as imidolactams. These are cyclic organooxygen compounds containing the structure RC(=N)N where the central carbon atom and one of the linked nitrogen atoms are part of the same ring( R here is an organyl group). They can also be viewed as analogs of lactams where the oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom. Xi-4, 5-dihydro-2, 4(5)-dimethyl-1H-imidazole is soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, xi-4, 5-dihydro-2, 4(5)-dimethyl-1H-imidazole can be found in fishes. This makes xi-4, 5-dihydro-2, 4(5)-dimethyl-1H-imidazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
