it is a 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carbonitrile that has S-configuration at the chiral centre. It is the active enantiomer of citalopram. It has a role as an antidepressant and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (R)-citalopram. it is the active S-stereoisomer of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram with antidepressant, anti-obsessive-compulsive and antibulimic properties. it inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane of the presynaptic cell, thereby increasing levels of 5-HT within the synaptic cleft and enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT1A autoreceptors. Unlike other SSRIs, it appears to not only bind to a primary high-affinity site on the serotonin transporter protein but also to a secondary lower-affinity allosteric site that is considered to stabilize and prolong drug binding.
