Dihydromethysticin, also known as DHM or pseudomethysticin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as kavalactones. These are lactones, which is structurally characterized by a benzene ring and a pyranone moiety, linked to each other to form a 4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one skeleton. Dihydromethysticin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, dihydromethysticin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, dihydromethysticin can be found in beverages. This makes dihydromethysticin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
