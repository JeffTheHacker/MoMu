it is a piperidine-based anti-histamine compound. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist and an anti-allergic agent. It is a member of piperidines and a tertiary amine. It derives from an isobutyric acid. it is a second generation, long-lasting selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist with antiinflammatory property. it is a highly selective and reversible competitor at peripheral H1 histamine receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This agent interferes with mediators release from mast cells either by inhibiting calcium ion influx across mast cell/basophil plasma membrane or by inhibiting intracellular calcium ion release within the cells. In addition it may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction by acting on leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Overall, this agent blocks the actions of endogenous histamine, thereby leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms associated with histamine and achieve effects such as decreased vascular permeability, reduction of pruritus and localized smooth muscle relaxation.
