it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cardenolide glycosides and derivatives. Cardenolide glycosides and derivatives are compounds containing a carbohydrate glycosidically bound to the cardenolide moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, dihydrodigoxin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
