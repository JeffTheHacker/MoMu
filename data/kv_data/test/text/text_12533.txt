it is a compound composed of a central piperidine structure with hydroxy and p-chlorophenyl substituents at position 4 and an N-linked p-fluorobutyrophenone moiety. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist, a first generation antipsychotic, a dopaminergic antagonist, an antidyskinesia agent and an antiemetic. It is a hydroxypiperidine, an organofluorine compound, an aromatic ketone, a tertiary alcohol and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is a phenylbutylpiperadine derivative with antipsychotic, neuroleptic, and antiemetic activities. it competitively blocks postsynaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the mesolimbic system of the brain, thereby eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to antidelusionary and antihallucinagenic effects. Antagonistic activity mediated through D2 dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) accounts for its antiemetic activity.
