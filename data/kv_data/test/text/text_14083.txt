it, also known as epi-cubenol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, cubenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, cubenol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes cubenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
