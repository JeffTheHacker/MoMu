it is a sulfonamide that is N-phenylmethanesulfonamide in which the phenyl group is sustituted at position 4 by a 1-hydroxy-2-(isopropylamino)ethyl group. It has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. It is used (usually as the hydrochloride salt) for the management of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of ethanolamines, a secondary amino compound, a secondary alcohol and a sulfonamide. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an ethanolamine derivative with Class III antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive properties. it is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor and potassium channel antagonist. In the heart, this agent inhibits chronotropic and inotropic effects thereby slowing the heart rate and decreasing myocardial contractility. This agent also reduces sinus rate, slows conduction in the atria and in the atrioventricular (AV) node and increases the functional refractory period of the AV node.
