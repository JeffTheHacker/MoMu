it is a ginsenoside found in Panax notoginseng that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 6alpha, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy groups at positions 6 and 20 have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and beta-D-glucopyranoside respectively, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antioxidant, a neuroprotective agent, an apoptosis inducer and a phytoestrogen. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a disaccharide derivative, a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
