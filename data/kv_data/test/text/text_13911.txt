2, 6-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol, also known as 4-hydroxymethyl-2, 6-di-tert-butylphenol or 3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzyl alcohol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety. 2, 6-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
