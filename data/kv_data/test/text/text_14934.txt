it is a pyrimidine that is 5-(pyrimidin-2-yl}amino-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide substituted at position 4 by a (2,3-dimethylindazol-6-yl)(methyl)amino group. Used as its hydrochloride salt for treatment of kidney cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is a member of indazoles, an aminopyrimidine and a sulfonamide. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple protein tyrosine kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2 and -3, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), which may result in inhibition of angiogenesis in tumors in which these receptors are upregulated.
