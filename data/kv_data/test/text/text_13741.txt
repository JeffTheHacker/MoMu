it is a white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water. It is noncombustible. The primary hazard of this material is that it poses a threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment. it is used in photography, in fabric printing, in chemical analysis, and in many other uses. it is a cadmium coordination entity in which cadmium(2+) and Cl(-) ions are present in the ratio 2:1. Although considered to be ionic, it has considerable covalent character to its bonding. it is a whitish, crystalline, inorganic compound that forms toxic fumes of cadmium oxides when heated. it is used in electroplating, printing, photocopying, dyeing, mirrors, vacuum tubes, lubricants, analytical chemistry and as a chemical intermediate to produce cadmium containing pigments and stabilizers. Exposure to this substance irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract and causes damage to the lungs resulting in shortness of breath, chest pain and pulmonary edema, and can also damage the kidneys causing proteinuria and decreased renal function. it is a known carcinogen and is associated with an elevated risk of developing lung cancer.
