A factor synthesized in a wide variety of tissues. It acts synergistically with TGF-alpha in inducing phenotypic transformation and can also act as a negative autocrine growth factor. it has a potential role in embryonal development, cellular differentiation, hormone secretion, and immune function. it is found mostly as homodimer forms of separate gene products it1, it2 or it3. Heterodimers composed of it1 and 2 (it1.2) or of it2 and 3 (it2.3) have been isolated. The it proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins.
