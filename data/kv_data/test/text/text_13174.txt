it, also known as (2E)-but-2-enal or crotonal, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as enals. These are an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde of general formula RC=C-CH=O in which the aldehydic C=O function is conjugated to a C=C triple bond at the alpha, beta position it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa) it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and saliva. Within the cell, (e)-2-butenal is primarily located in the cytoplasm it is a flower tasting compound that can be found in fruits, garden tomato, and potato. This makes (e)-2-butenal a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
