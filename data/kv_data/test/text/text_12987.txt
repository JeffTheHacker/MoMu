it is an organic thiophosphate that is the S-phospho derivative of 2-[(3-aminopropyl)amino]ethanethiol. A prodrug for the free thiol, WR-1065, which is used as a cytoprotectant in cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It has a role as a prodrug, a radiation protective agent and an antioxidant. It is a diamine and an organic thiophosphate. It derives from a cysteamine. it Anhydrous is a phosphorylated aminosulfhydryl compound with cytoprotective activity. it is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase to an active free sulfhydryl (thiol) metabolite in the body. The thiol metabolite binds to and detoxifies cytotoxic platinum-containing metabolites of cisplatin and scavenges free radicals induced by cisplatin and ionizing radiation. The elevated activity of this agent in normal tissues results from both the relative abundance of alkaline phosphatase in normal tissues and the greater vascularity of normal tissues compared to tumor tissues.
