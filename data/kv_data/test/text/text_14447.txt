2, 4-Dimethylthiophene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. 2, 4-Dimethylthiophene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 4-dimethylthiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 4-dimethylthiophene can be found in garden onion and onion-family vegetables. This makes 2, 4-dimethylthiophene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
