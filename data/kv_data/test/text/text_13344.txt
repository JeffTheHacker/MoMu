it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyanogenic glycosides. These are glycosides in which the aglycone moiety contains a cyanide group. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, gynocardin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, gynocardin can be found in fruits and rowal. This makes gynocardin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
