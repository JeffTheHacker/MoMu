3, 6-Dimethoxy-4-phenanthrenol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrols. Phenanthrols are compounds containing a phenanthrene (or its hydrogenated derivative) to which a hydroxyl group is attached. 3, 6-Dimethoxy-4-phenanthrenol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3, 6-dimethoxy-4-phenanthrenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3, 6-dimethoxy-4-phenanthrenol can be found in opium poppy. This makes 3, 6-dimethoxy-4-phenanthrenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
