it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as scalarane sesterterpenoids. These are sesterterpenoids with a structure based on the scalarane backbone. Scalarane is a tetracyclic compound, which is similar the homoandrostane with five methyl groups at the 4-, 4-, 8-, 17-, 17a-positions. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
