it is a hydroxy ketone ascaroside that is ascr#2 in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the ascarylopyranose moiety has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside. A metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is only weakly dauer inducing, but synergises with ascr#2, ascr#3, and ascr#8 in male attraction. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite and a pheromone. It is a glycosyl glycoside derivative, a methyl ketone and a hydroxy ketone ascaroside. It derives from an ascr#2.
