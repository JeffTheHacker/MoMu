it, also known as 3'-deoxymaysin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid c-glycosides. Flavonoid C-glycosides are compounds containing a carbohydrate moiety which is C-glycosidically linked to the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid backbone. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, apimaysin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, apimaysin can be found in cereals and cereal products and corn. This makes apimaysin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
