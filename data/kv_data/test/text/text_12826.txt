Melleolide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as melleolides and analogues. Melleolides and analogues are compounds with a structure characterized by the presence of a 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-methylbenzoic acid derivative linked to a 3, 6, 6, 7b-tetramethyl-cyclobuta[e]indene moiety. Melleolide exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, melleolide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, melleolide can be found in mushrooms. This makes melleolide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
