it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Refractory Anemia With Excess Blasts, Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, and Adult Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (M3), among others. it is a nonsedating benzodiazepine derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor it inhibits the enzyme farnesyltransferase and the post-translational farnesylation of number of proteins involved in signal transduction, which may result in the inhibition of Ras function and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. This agent may reverse the malignant phenotype of H-Ras-transformed cells and has been shown to be active against tumor cells with and without Ras mutations.
