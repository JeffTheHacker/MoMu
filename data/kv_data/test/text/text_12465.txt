it is the 1-[(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy]ethyl (proxetil) ester prodrug of cefpodoxime. After swallowing, hydrolysis of the ester group occurs in the intestinal epithelium, to release active cefpodoxime in the bloodstream. It is used to treat acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis. It has a role as a prodrug and an antibacterial drug. It is a carboxylic ester, a cephalosporin and a carboxylic acid. It derives from a cefpodoxime and a 4-{((R)-2-Carboxy-3-methoxymethyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-aza-bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7-ylcarbamoyl)-[(Z)-methoxyimino]-methyl}-thiazol-2-yl-ammonium. Cefpodoxime Proxetil is a third generation semi-synthetic cephalosporin and a beta-lactam antibiotic with bactericidal activity. Cefpodoxime's effect is dependent on its binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Binding results in the inhibition of the transpeptidase enzymes, thereby preventing cross-linking of the pentaglycine bridge with the fourth residue of the pentapeptide and interrupting consequent synthesis of peptidoglycan chains. As a result, cefpodoxime inhibits bacterial septum and cell wall synthesis formation.
