2, 5-Dimethyl-3-(methylthio)furan belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl thioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by an aryl group. 2, 5-Dimethyl-3-(methylthio)furan is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 5-dimethyl-3-(methylthio)furan is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 5-dimethyl-3-(methylthio)furan can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 2, 5-dimethyl-3-(methylthio)furan a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
