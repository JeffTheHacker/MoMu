it, also known as vescalene or castalagin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydrolyzable tannins. These are tannins with a structure characterized by either of the following models. In model 1, the structure contains galloyl units (in some cases, shikimic acid units) that are linked to diverse polyol carbohydrate-, catechin-, or triterpenoid units. In model 2, contains at least two galloyl units C-C coupled to each other, and do not contain a glycosidically linked catechin unit. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, vescalagin can be found in nuts. This makes vescalagin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
