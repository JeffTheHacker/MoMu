Budesonide is a corticosteroid that undergoes high first pass elimination by the liver so that systemic levels after oral administration are minimal. Budesonide has been used orally for several immune mediated gastrointestinal and liver diseases and as nasal spray or by inhalation for allergic rhinitis, asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. Neither inhalant nor oral budesonide has been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to convincing instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.
