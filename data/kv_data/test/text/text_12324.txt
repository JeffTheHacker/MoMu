it is an androstanoid that is androst-5-ene substituted by a beta-hydroxy group at position 3 and an oxo group at position 17. It is a naturally occurring steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It has a role as an androgen, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 17-oxo steroid, an androstanoid and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid. it is a synthetic form of it with potential chemopreventive activity. Produced endogenously, it (it) is an intermediate in the conversion of cholesterol to androgens and estrogens. Although the mechanisms of action of exogenously administered it have not been fully illuminated, they may result in both direct and indirect physiologic effects. Direct effects include GABA-a receptor complex and NMDA receptor modulation, and enhanced pancreatic beta cell insulin secretion and antiglucocorticoid activities. (NCI04)
