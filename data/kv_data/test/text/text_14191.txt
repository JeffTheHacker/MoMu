it, also known as it or fema 2206, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it exists as a liquid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, butyl dodecanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a fruity, oily, and peanut tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, fruits, and pomes. This makes butyl dodecanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
