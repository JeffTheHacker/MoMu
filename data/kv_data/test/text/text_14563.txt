Cedryl acetate belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cedrane and isocedrane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiternoids with a structure based on the cedrane or the isocedrane skeleton. Cedrane is a tricyclic molecules a 3, 6, 8, 8-tetramethyl-1H-3a, 7-methano-azulene moiety. Isocedrane is a rearranged cedrane arising from the migration of methyl group moved from the 6-position to the 4-position. Cedryl acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, cedryl acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Cedryl acetate has a cedar, dry, and sharp taste.
