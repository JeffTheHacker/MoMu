it is an N-sulfonylurea that is urea in which a hydrogen attached to one of the nitrogens has been replaced by an (o-carboxybenzyl)sulfonyl group, while a hydrogen attached to the other nitrogen has been replaced by a 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl group. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used (particularly as its methyl ester, it-methyl) as a herbicide for the control of a variety of both annual and perennial weeds in crops, particularly wheat and rice. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea, an aromatic ether, a member of pyrimidines and a member of benzoic acids.
