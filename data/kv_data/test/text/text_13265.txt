it is the ester resulting from the formal condensation of 1-cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid with 2-(diethylamino)ethanol. An anticholinergic, it is used as the hydrochloride to treat or prevent spasm in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly that associated with irritable bowel syndrome. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist, an antispasmodic drug and a parasympatholytic. It is a tertiary amine and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a 2-diethylaminoethanol and a 1,1'-bi(cyclohexyl)-1-carboxylic acid. it is a carboxylic acid derivative and a selective anticholinergic with antispasmodic activity. it blocks acetylcholine from binding to muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle. This agent has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle and therefore prevents spasms in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility, decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretion.
