3, 7(11)-Eudesmadiene, also known as selina-3, 7(11)-dien or aristolochene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. 3, 7(11)-Eudesmadiene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3, 7(11)-eudesmadiene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3, 7(11)-eudesmadiene can be found in alcoholic beverages, fats and oils, and ginger. This makes 3, 7(11)-eudesmadiene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
