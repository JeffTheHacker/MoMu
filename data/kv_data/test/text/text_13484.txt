it is a vinca alkaloid, an indole alkaloid fundamental parent, a methyl ester, an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a tertiary amino compound, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and an organic heteropentacyclic compound. Vinblastine is a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. Vinblastine binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule formation, resulting in disruption of mitotic spindle assembly and arrest of tumor cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. This agent may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.
