Gadobenic acid (in the form of it dimeglumine) is an MRI contrast agent used primarily for MR imaging of the liver. It can also be used for visualizing the CNS and heart. In contrast to conventional extracellular fluid contrast agents, it dimeglumine is characterized by a weak and transient binding capacity to serum proteins. This binding leads to an increased relaxivity of it dimeglumine and, consequently, to a considerably increased signal intensity over that of other agents.
