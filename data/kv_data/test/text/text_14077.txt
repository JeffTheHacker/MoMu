Gramcidin D is a heterogeneous mixture of three antibiotic compounds, gramicidins A, B and C, making up 80%, 6%, and 14% respectively all of which are obtained from the soil bacterial species Bacillus brevis and called collectively it. Gramcidins are 15 residue peptides with alternating D and L amino acids, which assemble inside of the hydrophobic interior of the cellular lipid bilayer to form a Î²-helix. Active against most Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative organisms, it is used primarily as a topical antibiotic and is also found in Polysporin ophthalmic solution.
