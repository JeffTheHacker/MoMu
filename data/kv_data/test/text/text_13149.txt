it is a white crystalline powder. Melting point 137.5-140Â°C. Used as an antihypertensive drug. it is the hydrochloride salt form of phenoxybenzamine, a synthetic, dibenzamine alpha-adrenergic antagonist with antihypertensive and vasodilatory properties. Phenoxybenzamine non-selectively and irreversibly blocks the postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptor in smooth muscle, thereby preventing vasoconstriction, relieving vasospasms, and decreasing peripheral resistance. Reflex tachycardia may occur and may be enhanced by blockade of alpha-2 receptors which enhances norepinephrine release. Phenoxybenzamine is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
