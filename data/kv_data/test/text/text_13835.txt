it is a tetracyclic diterpenoid that is 10-deacetylbaccatin III having O-methyl groups attached at positions 7 and 10 as well as an O-(2R,3S)-3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl group attached at position 13. Acts as a microtubule inhibitor, binds tubulin and promotes microtubule assembly and simultaneously inhibits disassembly. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-stabilising agent. It derives from a 10-deacetylbaccatin III. it is a semi-synthetic derivative of the natural taxoid 10-deacetylbaccatin III with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, this agent is a poor substrate for the membrane-associated, multidrug resistance (MDR), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors. In addition, it penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
