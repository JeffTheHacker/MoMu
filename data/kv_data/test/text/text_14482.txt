it is a macrolide consisting resulting from the formal lactonisation of the carboxy group of (2E,4E,6R,7S,8S,10E,12E,14S,15R,16S,17R,18S)-18-[(2R,4R,5S,6R)-4-{[(2E)-3-carboxyprop-2-enoyl]oxy}-2-hydroxy-5,6-dimethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl]-7,15,17-trihydroxy-14-methoxy-2,4,6,8,10,16-hexamethylnonadeca-2,4,10,12-tetraenoic acid with the hydroxy group at position 15. It is active against SV40 tumour cells, and inhibits the growth of solid tumour-derived cell lines such as DLD-1 human colon cancer cells with increased cells in G1 and S phases. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antineoplastic agent and a bacterial metabolite. It is a macrolide, a cyclic hemiketal, a member of oxanes, a secondary alcohol, an enoate ester, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an ether.
