Kava kava is an herbal derived from roots of the plant Piper methysticum, which has been used for centuries as a recreational and ceremonial drink in Oceania and more recently in concentrated forms in herbal medications to treat anxiety and insomnia. Products labeled as kava have been linked to the development of clinically apparent acute liver injury which can be severe and even fatal.
