2, 3, 4, 5, 6-Pentachlorobenzyl alcohol, also known as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentachlorobenzenemethanol, 9CI or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzyl alcohols. These are organic compounds containing the phenylmethanol substructure. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-Pentachlorobenzyl alcohol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentachlorobenzyl alcohol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
