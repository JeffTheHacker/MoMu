it, also known as palmitic acid, iso octyl ester or 6-methylheptyl palmitate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as macrolides and analogues. These are organic compounds containing a lactone ring of at least twelve members. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 12-methyl-13-tridecanolide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 12-methyl-13-tridecanolide can be found in fats and oils, green vegetables, and herbs and spices. This makes 12-methyl-13-tridecanolide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
