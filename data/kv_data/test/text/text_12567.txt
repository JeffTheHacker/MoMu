it is a barbiturate, the structure of which is that of 2-thiobarbituric acid substituted at C-5 by ethyl and sec-pentyl groups. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, a sedative, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a drug allergen and an intravenous anaesthetic. It derives from a 2-thiobarbituric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it Sodium is the sodium salt form of it, an ultrashort-acting barbituric acid derivative, with anesthetic activity. it binds to the chloride ionophore site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A/chloride ionophore receptor complex, thereby enhancing the inhibitory actions of GABA-A in the brain. This leads to synaptic inhibition, decreased neuronal excitability and induction of anesthesia. In addition, this agent decreases glutamate (Glu) responses.
