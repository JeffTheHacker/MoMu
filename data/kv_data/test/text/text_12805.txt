it, also known as 1, 3-dipropylacetonyl 2-methyl-3-furyl sulfide or fema 3571, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl thioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by an aryl group. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-[(2-methyl-3-furanyl)thio]-5-nonanone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it has a meaty and roasted taste.
