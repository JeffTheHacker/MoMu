Furagin is an imidazolidine-2,4-dione that is hydantoin substituted at position 1 by a [3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)prop-2-en-1-ylidene]amino group (the configuration of the C=C and C=N bonds in the grouping that links the two heterocycles is not specified). A nitrofuran antibiotic with properties similar to nitrofurantoin, furagin is used in the treatment of urinary tract infections. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and an antiinfective agent. It is an imidazolidine-2,4-dione, a nitrofuran antibiotic, an organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic and an organooxygen heterocyclic antibiotic. It derives from a semicarbazide.
