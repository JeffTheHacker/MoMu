it is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which residue 9 (N-methylleucine) has been hydroxylated at the carbon bearing the two methyl groups and in which residue 1 [(2S,3R,4R,6E)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)oct-6-enoic acid] has been hydroxylated at position 8 while the hydroxy group at position 3 has undergone addition to the double bond to give the corresponding oxolane. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative, a member of oxolanes and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M8.
