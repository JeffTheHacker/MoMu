it is a D-aldohexose that is D-glucose in which the hydrogen of the hydroxy group at position 3 has been substituted by a methyl group. It is a non-metabolisable glucose analogue that is not phosphorylated by hexokinase and is used as a marker to assess glucose transport by evaluating its uptake within various cells and organ systems. It derives from an aldehydo-D-glucose.
