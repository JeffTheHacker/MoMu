it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthridines and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthridine moiety, which is a tricyclic system with two benzene rings joined by a pyridine forming a non-linear skeleton. Hydrogenated derivatives are also included. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
