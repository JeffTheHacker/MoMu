it is a member of the class of acridines that is acridine substituted by a chloro group at position 6, a methoxy group at position 2 and a [5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]nitrilo group at position 9. It has a role as an antimalarial and an EC 1.8.1.12 (trypanothione-disulfide reductase) inhibitor. It is a member of acridines, an organochlorine compound, an aromatic ether and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a hydride of an acridine. it Hydrochloride is the dihydrochloride salt of the 9-aminoacridine derivative it with potential antineoplastic and antiparasitic activities. it may inhibit the transcription and activity of both basal and inducible nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which may result in the induction of tumor suppressor p53 transcription, the restoration of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways, and tumor cell apoptosis. Continuous NF-kappaB signaling, present in many tumors and in chronic inflammatory processes, promotes the expression of antiapoptotic proteins and cytokines while downregulating the expression of proapoptotic proteins, such as p53.
