it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aporphines. These are quinoline alkaloids containing the dibenzo[de, g]quinoline ring system or a dehydrogenated derivative thereof. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, dehydroaporheine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, dehydroaporheine can be found in coffee and coffee products and root vegetables. This makes dehydroaporheine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
