it is a member of the class of quinolines that is a mixed aminal resulting from the formal condensation oftrichloroacetaldehyde with the amide nitrogen of trans-cinnamamide and the primary amino group of 1-quinolin-8-ylthiourea. It is a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2alpha). It is a member of quinolines, a member of thioureas, an aminal, an organochlorine compound and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a trichloroacetaldehyde and a trans-cinnamamide.
