it, also known as PE(32:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phosphatidylethanolamines. These are glycerophosphoetahnolamines in which two fatty acids are bonded to the glycerol moiety through ester linkages. Thus, it is considered to be a glycerophosphoethanolamine lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and intracellular membrane. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Cytidine monophosphate and it can be biosynthesized from CDP-ethanolamine and DG(18:0/14:0/0:0); which is mediated by the enzyme choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase. Furthermore, it can be biosynthesized from PS(18:0/14:0); which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Furthermore, it can be biosynthesized from PS(18:0/14:0); which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Finally, Cytidine monophosphate and it can be biosynthesized from CDP-ethanolamine and DG(18:0/14:0/0:0) through its interaction with the enzyme choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase. In humans, it is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis PC(18:0/14:0) pathway and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis it pathway.
