it is a prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1) antagonist with niacin-induced vasodilation inhibiting activity. it binds to and inhibits the activity of DP1, a G-protein coupled receptor. Via competing with prostaglandin D2 (PG D2) for binding to DP1, this agent prevents PG D2-induced vasodilation and increased blood flow. As niacin induces the synthesis of PG D2, predominantly in the skin, administration of it may prevent niacin-induced vasodilation in the skin and facial flushing.
