it, also known as cyclohexyl lactone or octahydro-coumarin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a pyran ring. Pyran a six-membered heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring, made up of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom and containing two double bonds. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, octahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it has a sweet, coumarin, and herbal taste.
