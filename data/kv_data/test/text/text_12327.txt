Erythrohydrobupropion belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety. Erythrohydrobupropion is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, erythrohydrobupropion is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
