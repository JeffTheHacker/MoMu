it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-carbamoyl-alpha amino acids. N-carbamoyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an carbamoyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, N-carbamoyl-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, N-carbamoyl-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid can be found in pulses. This makes N-carbamoyl-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
