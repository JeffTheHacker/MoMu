Isopentyl mercaptan, also known as 2-methyl-4-butanethiol or fema 3858, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkylthiols. These are organic compounds containing the thiol functional group linked to an alkyl chain. Isopentyl mercaptan is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, isopentyl mercaptan is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Isopentyl mercaptan is a glue and onion tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes isopentyl mercaptan a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
