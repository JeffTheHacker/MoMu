it is a biaryl resulting from the formal oxidative dimerisation of two molecules of 5-hydroxy-6,8-dimethoxy-2-methyl-4H-benzo[g]chromen-4-one to form a single bond linking position 10 of each moiety (the 10Ra enantiomer). It has a role as a mycotoxin, an Aspergillus metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is a biaryl, a benzochromenone and a member of phenols.
