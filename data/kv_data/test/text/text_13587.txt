Menthyl isovalerate, also known as fema 2669 or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. Menthyl isovalerate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, menthyl isovalerate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Menthyl isovalerate is a sweet, bitter, and cooling tasting compound that can be found in peppermint. This makes menthyl isovalerate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
