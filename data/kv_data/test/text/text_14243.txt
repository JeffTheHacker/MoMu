it has been used in trials studying the diagnostic of Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung. it is a salicylic acid derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. it dislodges all Ras isoforms from their membrane-anchoring sites, thereby preventing activation of RAS signaling cascades that mediated cell proliferation, differentiation, and senescence. RAS signaling is believed to be abnormally activated in one-third of human cancers, including cancers of the pancreas, colon, lung and breast.
