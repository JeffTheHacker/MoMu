Cardionogen-1 is a triazolothiadiazole that is [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole which is substituted at positions 3 and 6 by 2-furyl and cyclohexyl groups, respectively. A cardiomyocyte promoter and an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin dependent transcriptional activity, it induces cardiac cell formation in murine stem cells and zebrafish embryos, expanding cardiac progenitor cells. A biphasic modulator of cardiogenesis, it can act as either a promotor or inhibitor of heart formation, depending on the stage of treatment. It has a role as a Wnt signalling inhibitor. It is a triazolothiadiazole and a member of furans.
