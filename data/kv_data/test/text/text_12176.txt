Cefmenoxime is a third-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. Cefmenoxime binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
