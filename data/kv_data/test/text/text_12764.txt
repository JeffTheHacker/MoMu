Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate appears as colorless to yellow or dark liquid or solid with a sweet, fruity, pungent odor. Melting point 68Â°F (20Â° C). Evolves CO2 when moist. This can cause over-pressurization in an enclosed space.Toxic and carcinogenic. Used in polyurethane foams, coatings in floor and wood finishes, sealers, paints, concrete sealers for aircraft and tank trucks, elastomers in clay pipe seals, elastomers and coatings, and crosslinking agent for nylon.   Rate of onset: Immediate  Persistence: Hours - weeks  Odor threshold: 0.4 - 2 ppm  Source/use/other hazard: Polyurethane (wood coatings, foam), nylon industries; skin irritant. Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is a toluene meta-diisocyanate in which the isocyanato groups are at positions 2 and 4 relative to the methyl group on the benzene ring. It has a role as a hapten and an allergen. Toluene Diisocyanate is a synthetic mixture of the 2,4- and 2,6-isomers is a volatile, colorless to pale yellow liquid that is soluble in many organic solvents. These isomers are used primarily in the synthesis of polyurethane foams. When heated to decomposition, toluene diisocyanate emits toxic fumes of cyanides and nitrogen oxides. Exposure of humans to toluene diisocyanate causes tissue irritation, especially to the mucous membranes, and can produce severe respiratory problems. These isomers are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. (NCI05)
