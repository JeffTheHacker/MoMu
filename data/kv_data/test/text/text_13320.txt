it is an organoammonium salt obtained by reaction of fosaprepitant with two equivalents of 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-D-glucitol. A substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and postoperative nausea and vomiting It has a role as a prodrug, an antiemetic and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist. It contains a fosaprepitant(2-). Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine is the dimeglumine salt form of fosaprepitant, the water-soluble, N-phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant, with antiemetic activity. Upon intravenous administration and rapid conversion to aprepitant, this agent binds selectively to the human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). This inhibits receptor binding of the endogenous substance P and prevents substance P-induced emesis.
