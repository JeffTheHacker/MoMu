it, also known as paracetamol cysteine or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as l-cysteine-s-conjugates. L-cysteine-S-conjugates are compounds containing L-cysteine where the thio-group is conjugated. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, acetaminophen cystein is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from NAPQI and glutathione through its interaction with the enzymes glutathione S-transferase p and glutathione S-transferase theta-1. In addition, it can be converted into acetaminophen cystein; which is catalyzed by the enzyme multidrug resistance-associated protein 1. In humans, acetaminophen cystein is involved in the acetaminophen metabolism pathway.
