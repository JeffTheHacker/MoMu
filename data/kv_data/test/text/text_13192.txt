These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains between 13 and 21 carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, saliva, and urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), cytoplasm and adiposome. Outside of the human body, it can be found in italian sweet red pepper and peanut.
