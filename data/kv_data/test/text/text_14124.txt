it has been used in trials studying the treatment and basic science of Melanoma, Lymphoma, Solid Tumors, Breast Cancer, and Ovarian Cancer, among others. it is an acyl-sulfonamide with potential antineoplastic activity. Selectively toxic towards tumor cells, it appears to induce tumor cell apoptosis by a mitochondrial-targeted mechanism involving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In combination with an angiogenesis inhibitor, this agent may exhibit synergistic antiangiogenic activity.
