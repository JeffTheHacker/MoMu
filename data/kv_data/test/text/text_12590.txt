it is the enoate ester that is the 1,2-bis(methacryloyl) derivative of ethylene glycol. It has a role as a cross-linking reagent, a polymerisation monomer and an allergen. It derives from an ethylene glycol and a methacrylic acid. it is an organic chemical and ester of methacrylic acid. it is a reactive resin used as a functional monomer and a crosslinking agent in polymer production. Via photopolymerization, this agent is a component of hydrogels, which are used in applications such as scaffolds for tissue engineering or drug delivery carriers. In turn, hydrogel products can be applied to the prevention of thrombosis, post-operative adhesion formations, and as coatings for biosensors.
