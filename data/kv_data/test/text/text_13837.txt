(Â±)-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydrofuranoquinolines. These are organic heterocyclic compounds with a structure based on the dihydrofuranoquinoline skeleton (Â±)-it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (Â±)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (Â±)-it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (Â±)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
