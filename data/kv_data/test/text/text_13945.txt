it is a member of the class of hexahydronaphthalenes that is 1,2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydronaphthalene which is substituted by a (3R,5R)-6-carboxy-3,5-dihydroxyhexyl group at position 1, a methyl group at position 2, and a (2S)-2-methylbutanoyloxy group at position 8 (the 1S,2S,8S,8aR isomer). Lactonisation of the hydroxy-carboxylic acid chain at position 1 affords mevastatin. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.34/EC 1.1.1.88 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase) inhibitor. It is a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid, a member of hexahydronaphthalenes, a polyketide and a carboxylic ester. It is a conjugate acid of a it anion.
