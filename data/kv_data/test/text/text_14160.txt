it is an oral prostacyclin and a metabolite of arachidonic acid with antihypertensive and platelet inhibitory properties. it binds to prostacyclin receptors on platelet surfaces, subsequently activating platelet membrane adenyl cyclase and resulting in increased cAMP levels. The elevated cAMP triggers signal transduction that leads to vasodilations. In addition, this agent also functions as an antagonist of thromboxane A2, thereby resulting in direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds, and inhibition of platelet aggregation.
