it has been used in trials studying the treatment and basic science of mCRPC, Leukemia, Neoplasm, BREAST CANCER, and Ovarian Cancer, among others. it is an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it selectively binds to chk1, thereby preventing activity of chk1 and abrogating the repair of damaged DNA. This may lead to an accumulation of damaged DNA and may promote genomic instability and apoptosis. it may potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1, a serine/threonine kinase, mediates cell cycle checkpoint control and is essential for DNA repair and plays a key role in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
