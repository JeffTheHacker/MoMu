it is an organic heterotetracyclic compound that is 6,6-dimethyl-5,6-dihydro-11H-benzo[b]carbazol-11-one carrying additional cyano, 4-(morpholin-4-yl)piperidin-1-yl and ethyl substituents at positions 3, 8 and 9 respectively. Used (as the hydrochloride salt) for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a member of morpholines, a member of piperidines, a nitrile and an aromatic ketone. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is an orally available inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it binds to and inhibits ALK kinase, ALK fusion proteins as well as the gatekeeper mutation ALKL1196M known as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to small-molecule kinase inhibitors. The inhibition leads to disruption of ALK-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors.
