it is the organic bromide salt of a 5alpha-androstane compound having 3alpha-acetoxy-, 17beta-acetoxy-, 2beta-piperidinino- and 16beta-N-methylpiperidinium substituents. It has a role as a nicotinic antagonist, a neuromuscular agent and a muscle relaxant. It is a quaternary ammonium salt and an organic bromide salt. It contains a vecuronium. It derives from a 5alpha-androstane. it is the bromide salt form of vecuronium, a synthetic steroid derivative of the naturally occurring alkaloids of curare with a muscle relaxant property. it competes with acetylcholine for the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles, thereby inhibiting the action of acetylcholine and blocking the neural transmission without depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane. This leads to skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis.
