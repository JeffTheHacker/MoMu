it is a methanesulfonate salt obtained by reaction of eribulin with one equivalent of methanesulfonic acid. A fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of marine sponge natural products. Inhibits growth phase of microtubules via tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism, which leads to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-destabilising agent. It contains an eribulin(1+). Eribulin Mesylate is the mesylate salt of a synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a substance derived from a marine sponge (Lissodendoryx sp.) with antineoplastic activity. Eribulin binds to the vinca domain of tubulin and inhibits the polymerization of tubulin and the assembly of microtubules, resulting in inhibition of mitotic spindle assembly, induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, and, potentially, tumor regression.
