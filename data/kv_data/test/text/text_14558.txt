Tamarixetin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 4'-o-methylated flavonoids. These are flavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C4' atom of the flavonoid backbone. Tamarixetin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Tamarixetin has been primarily detected in urine. Outside of the human body, tamarixetin can be found in tea. This makes tamarixetin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
