it is a benzonaphthyridine derivative, with antimalarial and potential antiviral activities. Upon administration, it inhibits the formation of beta-hematin, which results in the accumulation of toxic heme within the parasite. In addition, it inhibits glutathione-dependent degradation of hematin. This promotes hematin-induced lysis of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in parasite death. it also exhibits antiviral activity against some viruses in vitro, including Ebola (EBOV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses.
