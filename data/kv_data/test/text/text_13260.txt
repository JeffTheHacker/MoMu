it, also known as 7, 8-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as kavalactones. These are lactones, which is structurally characterized by a benzene ring and a pyranone moiety, linked to each other to form a 4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one skeleton. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, marindinin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, marindinin can be found in beverages. This makes marindinin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
