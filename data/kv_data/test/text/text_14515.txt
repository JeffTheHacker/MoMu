2, 4, 4-Trimethylcyclopentanone, also known as arylsulfonamide 11C, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclic ketones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone that is conjugated to a cyclic moiety. 2, 4, 4-Trimethylcyclopentanone is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 4, 4-trimethylcyclopentanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 4, 4-trimethylcyclopentanone can be found in fats and oils and herbs and spices. This makes 2, 4, 4-trimethylcyclopentanone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
