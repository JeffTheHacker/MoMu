Aucubin, also known as aucuboside or rhimantin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as iridoid o-glycosides. These are iridoid monoterpenes containing a glycosyl (usually a pyranosyl) moiety linked to the iridoid skeleton. Aucubin exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, aucubin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, aucubin can be found in common verbena. This makes aucubin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
