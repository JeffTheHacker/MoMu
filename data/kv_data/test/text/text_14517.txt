2, 3-Dimethylpyrazine, also known as fema 3271 or 2, 3-DMP pyrazine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. 2, 3-Dimethylpyrazine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3-dimethylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 2, 3-Dimethylpyrazine is an almond, butter, and caramel tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as herbs and spices, nuts, brassicas, and milk and milk products. This makes 2, 3-dimethylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
