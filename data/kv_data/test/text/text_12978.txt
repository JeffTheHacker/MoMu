Valyl-leucine, also known as V-L dipeptide or val-leu, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. Valyl-leucine is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Valyl-leucine has been primarily detected in feces.
