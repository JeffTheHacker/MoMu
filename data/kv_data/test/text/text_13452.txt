it is the sodium salt of cephapirin. A first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, it is effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Being more resistant to beta-lactamases than penicillins, it is effective agains most staphylococci, though not methicillin-resistant staphylococci. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a cephalosporin and an organic sodium salt. It contains a cephapirin(1-). it is the sodium salt form of cephapirin, a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum, beta-lactam, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis and subsequent cross-linking of peptidoglycan units. This results in a reduction of cell wall stability and leads to cell lysis.
