Cefprozil, also known as cefzil or arzimol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are compounds containing a 1, 2-thiazine fused to a 2-azetidinone to for a oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4. 2. 0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid moiety or a derivative thereof. Cefprozil is a drug which is used for the treatment of the following infections (respiratory, skin, soft tissue, uti, ent) caused by; s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, staphylococci, s. pyogenes (group a beta-hemolytic streptococci), e. coli, p. mirabilis, klebsiella sp, coagulase-negative staph. Cefprozil exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Cefprozil has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, cefprozil is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
