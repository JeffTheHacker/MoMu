it is a member of the class of hydroxyindoles resulting from the formal oxidative coupling between the 3-position of 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one and the 3-position of 1,3-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one, which is substituted at the 5 position by a 5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl group, where the newly-formed double bond has E configuration. It is a purple chromobacterial pigment that has antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoan, and anticancer properties. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer, an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agent. It is a member of hydroxyindoles, a member of pyrroles, a member of oxindoles and an olefinic compound. It derives from a proit.
