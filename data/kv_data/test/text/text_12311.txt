4'-Methoxybenzophenone-2-carboxylic acid, also known as (4-methoxybenzoyl)benzoic acid or O-(p-anisoyl)-benzoic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzophenones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone attached to two phenyl groups. 4'-Methoxybenzophenone-2-carboxylic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 4'-methoxybenzophenone-2-carboxylic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
