it is an acetate salt obtained by combining the nonapeptide leuprolide with acetic acid. A long lasting GnRH analog, LH-Rh agonist. It is a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and is used as a subcutaneous hydrogel implant for the treatment of prostate cancer and for the suppression of gonadal sex hormone production in children with central precocious puberty. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist. It contains a leuprolide. it is the acetate salt of a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Leuprolide binds to and activates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Continuous, prolonged administration of leuprolide in males results in pituitary GnRH receptor desensitization and inhibition of pituitary secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to a significant decline in testosterone production; in females, prolonged administration results in a decrease in estradiol production. This agent reduces testosterone production to castration levels and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression.
