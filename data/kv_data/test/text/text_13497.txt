it is a pale brown liquid. Relatively water insoluble. Used as an insecticide. it is a cyclopropanecarboxylate ester in which the esterifying alcohol is 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and the cyclopropane ring is substituted with a 2,2-dichlorovinyl group and with gem-dimethyl groups. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide, a pyrethroid ester acaricide, an agrochemical, an ectoparasiticide and a scabicide. It is a member of cyclopropanes and a cyclopropanecarboxylate ester. It derives from a 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. it is a synthetic pyrethroid and neurotoxin. it affects the neuronal membrane by blocking the movement of sodium ions from outside to inside the neuronal cell membrane thereby disrupting the sodium channel current that regulates the polarization of the membrane. This leads to delayed repolarization and subsequent paralysis of the nervous system. it is used to eradicate parasites such as head lice, ticks and scabies from humans and animals.
