it is an organic heteropentacyclic compound that is naloxone in which the keto group is replaced by a PEG moiety. Used for treatment of opioid-induced constipation. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist and a cathartic. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a member of phenols, an aromatic ether, a tertiary alcohol and a polyether. It derives from a naloxone. It derives from a hydride of a morphinan. it is a pegylated form of naloxone, a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, that can be used to reduce opioid-induced symptoms. Upon administration, it binds to and blocks mu-opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system. This prevents peripheral opioid receptor activation and abrogates opioid-induced side effects, such as opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Pegylation of naloxone reduces permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents this agent from interfering with the analgesic activity of opioid receptor agonists.
