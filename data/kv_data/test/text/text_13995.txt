it, also known as 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-pyrazine or fema 3554, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-methyl-5-isopropylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a coffee, earthy, and green tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as potato, coffee and coffee products, root vegetables, and cocoa and cocoa products. This makes 2-methyl-5-isopropylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
