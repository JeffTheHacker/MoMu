Isepamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic structurally related to gentamicin and amikacin. Isepamicin has activity similar to amikacin but with better activity against bacterial strains with resistance to other aminoglycosides, such as strains producing 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. Isepamicin is not metabolized and is excreted via the kidneys. This agent exerts a long postantibiotic effect allowing for once daily dosing.
