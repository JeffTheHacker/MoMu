N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine is a L-arginine derivative with a N(omega)-methyl substituent. It is a member of guanidines, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a L-arginine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of a N(omega)-methyl-L-argininate. It is a tautomer of a N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine zwitterion. it is a pan-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, tilarginine binds to and inhibits NOS, a free radical signaling molecule that promotes angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Reduction in NOS activity may abrogate the immunosuppressive TME, enhance tumor antigen-specific immune response and inhibit tumor cell proliferation.
