it is an N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfur atom is attached to a 4-(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methylthiophen-3-yl group and in which the non-sulfonated nitrogen is substituted by a 3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl group. It is a herbicide used for the selective control of grasses and broadleaf weeds primarily in corn. It has a role as an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical.
