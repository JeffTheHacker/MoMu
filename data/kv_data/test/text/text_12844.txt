it is a member of the class of N-nitrosoureas that is 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a nitroso group. It has a role as an alkylating agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of N-nitrosoureas and an organochlorine compound. it is an antineoplastic nitrosourea. it alkylates and cross-links DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, resulting in disruption of DNA function, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. This agent also carbamoylates proteins, including DNA repair enzymes, resulting in an enhanced cytotoxic effect. it is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier readily. (NCI04)
