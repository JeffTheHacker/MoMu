it is a member of the class of pyrrolecarboxamides obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 5-[(Z)-(5-chloro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4-dimethylpyrrole-3-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of N(1),N(1)-diethylethane-1,2-diamine. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an EC 3.1.4.12 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase) inhibitor. It is a pyrrolecarboxamide, a member of oxindoles, an organochlorine compound, a tertiary amino compound and an olefinic compound. It derives from a 3-methyleneoxindole.
