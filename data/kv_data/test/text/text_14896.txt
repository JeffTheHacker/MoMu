Erythrosine, also known as E127 or aizen erythrosine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthenes. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a xanthene moiety, which consists of two benzene rings joined to each other by a pyran ring. Erythrosine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, erythrosine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
