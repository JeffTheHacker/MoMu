it is a it molecular entity, a monoatomic dication and a divalent metal cation. it is a silvery white metallic element that belongs to period 6 of the lanthanoids family, with phosphate binding property. it, when administered in a salt form, dissociates in acid to release it ions, which then bind dietary phosphate. This agent inhibits the absorption of phosphate by forming highly insoluble it-phosphate complexes that reduce concentrations of serum phosphate and calcium phosphate.
