it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as brassinolides and derivatives. These are cholestane based steroid lactones containing benzo[c]indeno[5, 4-e]oxepin-3-one. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 24-epibrassinolide is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 24-epibrassinolide can be found in broad bean and pulses. This makes 24-epibrassinolide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
