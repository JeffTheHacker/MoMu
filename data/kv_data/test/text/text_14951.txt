2-O-palmitoyl-2'-O-sulfo-3-O-[(2E,4S,6S,8S)-2,4,6,8-tetramethyltriacont-2-enoyl]-alpha,alpha-trehalose is a sulfoglycolipid in which alpha,alpha-trehalose, sulfated at the 2'-position, is acylated at the 2-position with palmitic acid, and at the 3-position with (2S,4S,6S,8S)-2,4,6,8-tetramethyltriacontanoic acid. It has a role as an allergen. It is a sulfoglycolipid and a polyacyl alpha,alpha-trehalose derivative. It derives from an alpha,alpha-trehalose.
