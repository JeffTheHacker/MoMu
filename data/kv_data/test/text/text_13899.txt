it, aqueous solution, stabilized, with more than 60% it appears as a colorless liquid. Vapors may irritate the eyes and mucous membranes. Under prolonged exposure to fire or heat containers may violently rupture due to decomposition. Used to bleach textiles and wood pulp, in chemical manufacturing and food processing. it is an inorganic peroxide consisting of two hydroxy groups joined by a covalent oxygen-oxygen single bond. It has a role as an oxidising agent, a disinfectant, an explosive, an antimicrobial agent, a cofactor, a human xenobiotic metabolite, an apoptosis inducer, a GABA antagonist, a neurotoxin, a genotoxin, a biomarker, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite, a bleaching agent and an emetic. It is an inorganic peroxide and a member of reactive oxygen species. It is a conjugate acid of a hydrogenperoxide(1-). it is a peroxide and oxidizing agent with disinfectant, antiviral and anti-bacterial activities. Upon rinsing and gargling or topical application, it exerts its oxidizing activity and produces free radicals which leads to oxidative damage to proteins and membrane lipids. This may inactivate and destroy pathogens and may prevent spreading of infection.
