it is a synthetic bioactive retinoid with differentiation inducing and potential antineoplastic activities. Like other retinoic acid agents, it binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby altering the expression of certain genes leading to cell differentiation and decreased cell proliferation in susceptible cells.
