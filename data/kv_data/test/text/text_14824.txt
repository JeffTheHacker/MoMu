Cyclolaudenol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cycloartanols and derivatives. These are steroids containing a cycloartanol moiety. Cyclolaudenol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Cyclolaudenol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, cyclolaudenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, cyclolaudenol can be found in french plantain, opium poppy, potato, and soy bean. This makes cyclolaudenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
