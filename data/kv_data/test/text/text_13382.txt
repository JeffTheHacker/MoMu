it is a benzimidazole derivative that is used in combination with sofosbuvir (under the trade name Harvoni) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a hepatitis C protease inhibitor. It is a carbamate ester, a L-valine derivative, a bridged compound, a carboxamide, a benzimidazole, a member of fluorenes, an organofluorine compound, a member of imidazoles, a N-acylpyrrolidine and an azaspiro compound. it is an orally available inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) replication complex, with potential activity against HCV. Upon oral administration and after intracellular uptake, it binds to and blocks the activity of the NS5A protein. This results in the disruption of the viral RNA replication complex, blockage of HCV RNA production, and inhibition of viral replication. NS5A, a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein, plays a crucial role in HCV RNA replication. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family; HCV infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
