it (it) is a novel noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. it is orally bioavailable and inhibits the proliferation of primary human, mouse, rat, and dog lymphocytes at concentrations of approximately 100 nM. it is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor with activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV). IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, and treatment with it reduces the intracellular guanine nucleotide levels that are required for RNA and DNA synthesis, resulting in antiproliferative and antiviral effect.
