it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxyanthraquinones. Hydroxyanthraquinones are compounds containing a hydroxyanthraquinone moiety, which consists of an anthracene bearing a quinone, and hydroxyl group. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, heliocide H3 is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, heliocide H3 can be found in fats and oils. This makes heliocide H3 a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
