Dolasetron, also known as MDL 73147EF or anzemet, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indolecarboxylic acids and derivatives. Indolecarboxylic acids and derivatives are compounds containing a carboxylic acid group (or a derivative thereof) linked to an indole. Dolasetron exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Dolasetron has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, dolasetron is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Dolasetron is an indole derivative and a potent serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with anti-emetic property. Dolasetron blocks the activity of serotonin released from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by selectively inhibiting and inactivating 5-HT3 receptors located on the nerve terminals of the vagus nerve in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. This results in suppression of signalling to trigger chemo- and radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
