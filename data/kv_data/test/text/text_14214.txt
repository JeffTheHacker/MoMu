15-Dehydro-prostaglandin e1(1-) belongs to the class of organic compounds known as prostaglandins and related compounds. These are unsaturated carboxylic acids consisting of a 20 carbon skeleton that also contains a five member ring, and are based upon the fatty acid arachidonic acid. 15-Dehydro-prostaglandin e1(1-) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 15-Dehydro-prostaglandin e1(1-) has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 15-dehydro-prostaglandin e1(1-) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
