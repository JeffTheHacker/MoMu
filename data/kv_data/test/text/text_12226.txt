it is a colorless liquid with a distinctive acrid odor. Flash point 130Â°F. Boiling point 286Â°F. Freezing point 53Â°F. Corrosive to metals and tissue. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat can cause polymerization. If polymerization takes place in a closed container, violent rupture may occur. The inhibitor (usually hydroquinone) greatly reduces the tendency to polymerize. it is a alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid that is ethene substituted by a carboxy group.
