Sulindac sulfone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indenes and isoindenes. Indenes and isoindenes are compounds containing an indene moiety(which consists of a cyclopentadiene fused to a benzene ring), or a isoindene moiety (which consists of a cyclopentadiene fused to cyclohexadiene ring). Sulindac sulfone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Sulindac sulfone has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, sulindac sulfone is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
