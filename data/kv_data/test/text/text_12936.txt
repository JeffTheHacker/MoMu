it is a morpholine-based antiemetic, which is or the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. it is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. It has a role as an antidepressant, an antiemetic, a peripheral nervous system drug, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist and a substance P receptor antagonist. It is a member of triazoles, a member of morpholines, a cyclic acetal and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes. it is a small molecule, high-affinity substance P antagonist (SPA) with antiemetic activity. Crossing the blood brain barrier, it binds selectively to the human substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby inhibiting receptor binding of endogenous substance P and substance P-induced emesis. This agent has little or no affinity for serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors.
