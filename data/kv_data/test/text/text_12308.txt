it is a copolymer macromolecule composed of homopolymeric blocks of 1->4-linked homopolymeric blocks of 1->4-linked sodium beta-D-mannuronate and sodium alpha-L-guluronate residues, covalently linked together in different sequences or blocks. The sodium salt of alginic acid. It has a role as a hematologic agent. It is an organic sodium salt and a copolymer macromolecule. It contains an alginate. Sodium Alginate is the sodium salt form of alginic acid and gum mainly extracted from the cell walls of brown algae, with chelating activity. Upon oral administration, sodium alginate binds to and blocks the intestinal absorption of various radioactive isotopes, such as radium Ra 226 (Ra-226) and strontium Sr 90 (Sr-90).
