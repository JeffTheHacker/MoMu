it is an organochlorine compound that is urea in which the two hydrogens on one of the amino groups are replaced by nitroso and 2-chloroethyl groups and one hydrogen from the other amino group is replaced by a 4-methylcyclohexyl group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a carcinogenic agent and an alkylating agent. It is an organochlorine compound and a member of N-nitrosoureas. it is a methylated derivative of carmustine with antineoplastic activity. As an alkylating agent, it forms covalent linkages with nucleophilic centers in DNA, causing depurination, base-pair miscoding, strand scission, and DNA-DNA cross-linking, which may result in cytotoxicity.
