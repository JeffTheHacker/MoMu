it, also known as framidice 3 or menthol carboxamide WS-3, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ethyl menthane carboxamide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
