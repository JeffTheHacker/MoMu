it appears as a white crystalline solid. It forms a very flammable mixture with combustible materials and this mixture may be explosive if the combustible material is finely divided. The mixture can be ignited by friction. Contact with strong sulfuric acid can cause fires or explosions. When mixed with ammonium salts, spontaneous decomposition and ignition may result. Prolonged exposure of the material to fire or heat can result in an explosion. It is used in photography, in pyrotechnics, and as a herbicide.
