Alpha-Solanine, also known as Î-solanine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. Alpha-Solanine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Alpha-Solanine has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, Alpha-solanine is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, Alpha-solanine can be found in alcoholic beverages, garden tomato (var. ), and potato. This makes Alpha-solanine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. Alpha-Solanine is a potentially toxic compound.
