it is an organoiodine compound that is 3-amino-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid in which one of the amino hydrogens is substituted by a 6-(3-carboxy-2,4,6-triiodoanilino)-6-oxohexanoyl group. It is a water-soluble radiographic contrast media for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography. It has a role as a radioopaque medium. It is an organoiodine compound, a member of benzoic acids and a secondary carboxamide. It is a conjugate acid of an adipiodone(2-). it is a tri-iodinated benzoate derivative and ionic dimeric contrast agent used in diagnostic imaging. When administered in vivo, it is removed from the liver and secreted into the biliary tract. Like other organic iodine compounds, this agent blocks x-rays and appears opaque on x-ray film; thereby it enhances the visibility of the bile ducts and gallbladder during cholangiography and cholecystography procedures.
