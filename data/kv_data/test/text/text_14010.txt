1-Deoxynojirimycin, also known as it or moranoline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as piperidines. Piperidines are compounds containing a piperidine ring, which is a saturated aliphatic six-member ring with one nitrogen atom and five carbon atoms. 1-Deoxynojirimycin exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-deoxynojirimycin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-deoxynojirimycin can be found in fruits. This makes 1-deoxynojirimycin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
