4-Methylpyrrolo[1, 2-a]pyrazine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolopyrazines. Pyrrolopyrazines are compounds containing a pyrrolopyrazine moiety, which consists of a pyrrole ring fused to a pyrazine. Pyrrole is 5-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. Pyrazine is a 6-membered ring consisting of six carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at ring positions 1 and 4. 4-Methylpyrrolo[1, 2-a]pyrazine is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-methylpyrrolo[1, 2-a]pyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
