Ternatin, also known as ternatin A1, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligopeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of between three and ten alpha-amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Ternatin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, ternatin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
