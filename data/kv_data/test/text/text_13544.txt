3, 4-Diethylthiophene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. 3, 4-Diethylthiophene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3, 4-diethylthiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
