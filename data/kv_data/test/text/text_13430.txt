it is l-Phenylalaninamide substituted at the amide nitrogen by a 1-(dihydroxyboranyl)-3-methylbutyl group and at N(alpha) by a pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl group. It is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a proteasome inhibitor, a protease inhibitor and an antiprotozoal drug. It is an amino acid amide, a member of pyrazines and a L-phenylalanine derivative. It derives from a boronic acid. it is a dipeptide boronic acid analogue with antineoplastic activity. it reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex that degrades ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, it disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, it delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.
