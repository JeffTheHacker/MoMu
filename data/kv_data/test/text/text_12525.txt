it is the monophosphate ester obtained by condensation of phosphoric acid with the primary hydroxy group of pyridoxal. It has a role as a coenzyme, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a mouse metabolite, an EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor and a cofactor. It is a vitamin B6 phosphate, a member of methylpyridines, a monohydroxypyridine and a pyridinecarbaldehyde. It derives from a pyridoxal. It is a conjugate acid of a it(2-). it is the active form of vitamin B6 and a coenzyme for many it (PLP)-dependent enzymes. PLP is involved in numerous enzymatic transamination, decarboxylation and deamination reactions; it is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids and amino acid metabolites, and for the synthesis and/or catabolism of certain neurotransmitters, including the conversion of glutamate into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and levodopa into dopamine. PLP can be used as a dietary supplement in cases of vitamin B6 deficiency. Reduced levels of PLP in the brain can cause neurological dysfunction.
