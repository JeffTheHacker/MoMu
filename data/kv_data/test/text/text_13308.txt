it, also known as it or 4-methoxylonchocarpin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoxazoles. These are heterocyclic organic compounds containing an isoxazole moiety, with a structure characterized by a five-member aromatic ring with one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom at ring positions 1 and 2, respectively. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-oxo-2(5H)-isoxazolepropanenitrile is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 5-oxo-2(5H)-isoxazolepropanenitrile can be found in common pea and pulses. This makes 5-oxo-2(5H)-isoxazolepropanenitrile a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
