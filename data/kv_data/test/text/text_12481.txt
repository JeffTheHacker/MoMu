it is a 3beta-sterol that is 5alpha-androstane which contains a double bond between positions 7 and 8, in which the hydrogens at the 3beta, 5alpha and 6beta positions are substituted by hydroxy groups, and in which the hydrogen at the 17beta position is substituted by a (2S,3E,6xi)-6,7-dimethyloct-3-en-2-yl group. The polyhydroxylated C29 sterol was isolated from an endophytic fungus, Chaetomium globosum ZY-22; the stereochemistry at position 25 was not determined. It has a role as a Chaetomium metabolite. It is a 5alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 6beta-hydroxy steroid and a 3beta-sterol.
