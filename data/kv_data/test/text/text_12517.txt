it is an imidazobenzodiazepine that is 4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine which is substituted by a methyl, 2-fluorophenyl and chloro groups at positions 1, 6 and 8, respectively. It has a role as a GABAA receptor agonist, an anticonvulsant, an anxiolytic drug, an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent, a muscle relaxant, a sedative, a general anaesthetic and a central nervous system depressant. It is an organochlorine compound, an imidazobenzodiazepine and a member of monofluorobenzenes. it is a short-acting benzodiazepine derivative with an imidazole structure and with anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and sedative properties. it exerts its effect by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride ionophore complex in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to an increase in the opening of chloride channels, membrane hyperpolarization and increases the inhibitory effect of GABA in the CNS. it may also interfere with the reuptake of GABA, thereby causing accumulation of GABA in the synaptic cleft.
