Prelu-2 is a DEA Schedule III controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule III have a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I or II and abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. it is a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine with appetite depressant property. it is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active metabolite phenitzine, which competes with norepinephrine and dopamine for their presynaptic transporters, thereby blocks the reuptake of these monoamines at the neuronal junctions. As a result, this prolongs activities of dopamine and norepinephrine and leads to central nervous system (CNS) stimulation and metabolic effects, including appetite-suppression, decreased gastric acid secretion and increased blood pressure.
