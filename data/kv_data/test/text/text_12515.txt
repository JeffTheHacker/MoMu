it is the novel camptothecin derivative which is also known as it. It has been developed for superior oral bioavailability and increased lactone stability. It is used to treat cancer. it is a synthetic silicon-containing agent related to camptothecin with antineoplastic properties. it stabilizes the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks and consequently triggering apoptosis. Because it is lipophilic, cositecan exhibits enhanced tissue penetration and bio-availability compared to water-soluble camptothecins.
