it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. These are analogues of nucleosides and nucleotides. These include phosphonated nucleosides, C-glycosylated nucleoside bases, analogues where the sugar unit is a pyranose, and carbocyclic nucleosides, among others. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, lamivudine sulfoxide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it can be biosynthesized from lamivudine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme sulfotransferase 1A1. In humans, lamivudine sulfoxide is involved in the lamivudine metabolism pathway.
