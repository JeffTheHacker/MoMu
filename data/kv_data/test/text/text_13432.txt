it is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid that is L-glutamine in which one of the hydrogens attached to the amide nitrogen is replaced by a 1-hydroxycyclopropyl group. Found in the ink-cap mushroom, Coprinus atramentarius, it causes an unpleasant hypersensitivity to alcohol (the 'disulfiram effect'). It has a role as an EC 1.2.1.3 [aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(+))] inhibitor, a metabolite and a mycotoxin. It is a member of cyclopropanes, a dicarboxylic acid monoamide, a L-glutamine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid.
