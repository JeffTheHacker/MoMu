it, also known as 1-cyano-8-(methylthio)octane or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles. Nitriles are compounds having the structure RC#N; thus C-substituted derivatives of hydrocyanic acid, HC#N. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 9-(methylthio)nonanenitrile is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 9-(methylthio)nonanenitrile can be found in green vegetables. This makes 9-(methylthio)nonanenitrile a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
