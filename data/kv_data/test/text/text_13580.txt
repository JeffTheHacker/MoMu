it, also known as a-amyrin acetic acid or -amyrenyl acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Alpha-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Alpha-it can be found in mugwort. This makes Alpha-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
