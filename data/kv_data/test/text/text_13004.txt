it is a 1-phenylpropan-2-amine that has S configuration. It has a role as a neurotoxin, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, a dopaminergic agent, a sympathomimetic agent, a dopamine uptake inhibitor and an adrenergic agent. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-amphetamine. it is a synthetic substance related to natural sympathomimetic amines and the synthetic agent amphetamine. In the central nervous system (CNS), it induces the release of dopamine within the mesocorticolimbic system, a major component of the brain reward system, resulting in measurable behavioral changes such as euphoria. As a CNS stimulant, this agent may increase blood pressure and reduce appetite. Similar to other amphetamines, it has a high potential for abuse, dependence, and addiction if used in large doses over extended periods of time. (NCI04)
