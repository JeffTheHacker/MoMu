it is d-Glucopyranose with beta configuration at the anomeric centre. It has a role as an epitope and a mouse metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a beta-L-glucose. it is the beta isoform of D-glucopyranose, a synthetic simple monosaccharide as an energy source. D-glucopyranose is oxidized in various tissues either under aerobic or anaerobic conditions through glycolysis, and the oxidation reaction produces carbon dioxide, water and ATP.
