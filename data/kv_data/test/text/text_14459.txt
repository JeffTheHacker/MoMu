it is a biphenylyltetrazole that is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used mainly for the treatment of hypertension. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a biphenylyltetrazole and an azaspiro compound. it is a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist with antihypertensive activity. it selectively and competitively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin I receptor. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by adrenal cortex, which decreases the excretion of sodium and increases the excretion of potassium. Angiotensin II also acts as a vasoconstrictor in vascular smooth muscle. (NCI05)
