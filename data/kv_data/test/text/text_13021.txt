It is a tertiary amine and a member of amphetamines. it is a sympathomimetic amine related to the synthetic agent amphetamine with central nervous system (CNS) stimulating and anorexic properties. it stimulates the release of certain catecholamines, particularly noradrenaline and dopamine, from nerve terminals in the brain and inhibits their uptake. The increase in synaptic concentrations of these catecholamines causes behavioral changes including euphoria, an increase in mental alertness and excitement, and suppresses appetite.
