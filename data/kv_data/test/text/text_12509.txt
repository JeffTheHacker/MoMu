S-Allylcysteine, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cysteine and derivatives. Cysteine and derivatives are compounds containing cysteine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of cysteine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. S-Allylcysteine exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, S-allylcysteine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. S-Allylcysteine is a cooked and roasted tasting compound that can be found in garden onion, onion-family vegetables, and soft-necked garlic. This makes S-allylcysteine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
