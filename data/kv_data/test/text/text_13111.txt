it appears as a colorless liquid with an odor of lemon. Flash point 113Â°F. Density about 7.2 lb /gal and insoluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors heavier than air. Used as a solvent for rosin, waxes, rubber; as a dispersing agent for oils, resins, paints, lacquers, varnishes, and in floor waxes and furniture polishes. it is a monoterpene that is cyclohex-1-ene substituted by a methyl group at position 1 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 4 respectively. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a monoterpene and a cycloalkene. It derives from a hydride of a p-menthane. Lemon Oil is the oil extracted from the fruit peel of Citrus limon. Lemon oil is used as a flavoring and for its aromatic qualities. It is also said to have many medicinal purposes. it, (+/-)- is a racemic mixture of it, a natural cyclic monoterpene and major component of the oil extracted from citrus rind with chemo-preventive and antitumor activities. The metabolites of DL-it, perillic acid, dihydroperillic acid, uroterpenol and it 1,2-diol are suggested to inhibit tumor growth through inhibition of p21-dependent signaling, induce apoptosis via the induction of the transforming growth factor beta-signaling pathway, inhibit post-translational modification of signal transduction proteins, result in G1 cell cycle arrest as well as cause differential expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes.
