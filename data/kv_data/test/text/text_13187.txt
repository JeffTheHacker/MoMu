endo-1, 4-beta-Xylanase, also known as it or 311-09-1 (di-chloride), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylmethylamines. Phenylmethylamines are compounds containing a phenylmethtylamine moiety, which consists of a phenyl group substituted by an methanamine. endo-1, 4-beta-Xylanase is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, endo-1, 4-beta-xylanase is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
