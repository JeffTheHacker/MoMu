it ((18)F) is a member of the class of stilbenoids in which the para-hydrogens of stilbene are replaced by methylamino and 2-{2-[2-((18)F)fluoroethoxy]ethoxy}ethoxy) groups. A positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. It has a role as a radioactive imaging agent. It is a stilbenoid, a substituted aniline, a secondary amino compound, a (18)F radiopharmaceutical, a polyether and an aromatic ether. it is a stilbene derivative labeled with the positron-emitting isotope fluorine F 18, that may be used for positron emission tomography (PET) detection of beta-amyloid neuritic plaques and other amyloid protein deposits. Upon administration, F 18-florbetaben exhibits differential retention in regions that contain certain amyloid deposits. Differences in signal intensity between tissues showing specific and non-specific uptake of F 18-florbetaben allows for the detection of amyloid neuritic plaques in patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease, and potentially the detection of amyloid deposits in amyloidosis.
