(S)-25-Hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. Thus, (S)-25-hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule (S)-25-Hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule (S)-25-Hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (S)-25-hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (S)-25-hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione can be found in cereals and cereal products. This makes (S)-25-hydroxy-14, 16-hentriacontanedione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
