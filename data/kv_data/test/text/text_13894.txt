it is a sulfonamide, a member of pyrimidines and a primary alcohol. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and an endothelin receptor antagonist. it is a sulfonamide-derived, competitive and specific endothelin receptor antagonist with a slightly higher affinity for the endothelin A receptor than endothelin B receptor. it blocks the action of endothelin 1, an extremely potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor, by binding to endothelin A and endothelin B receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. it decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and is particularly used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
