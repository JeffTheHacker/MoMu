Mefloquine is a quinoline derivative used for the prevention and therapy of P. falciparum malaria. Mefloquine therapy is associated with a low rate of transient and asymptomatic serum enzyme elevations and is a rare cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is the hydrochloride salt form of mefloquine, a piperidinyl quinidine with antimalarial activity. Although the exact mechanism of it is largely unknown, this agent acts as a blood schizonticide and probably exert its actions by interacting with the phospholipid bilayer, thereby interfering with the stability of the cell membrane and causing cell lysis. it is active against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
