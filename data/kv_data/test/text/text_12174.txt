2, 4-Heptadecanedione, also known as it or tetradecanoylacetone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta-diketones. These are organic compounds containing two keto groups separated by a single carbon atom. 2, 4-Heptadecanedione exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 4-heptadecanedione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 4-heptadecanedione can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 4-heptadecanedione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
