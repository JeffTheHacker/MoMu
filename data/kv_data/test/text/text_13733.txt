Glucosamine is a popular nutritional supplement and natural component of cartilage that is frequently combined with it and used for osteoarthritis and nonspecific joint pain. Glucosamine has been implicated in isolated case reports in causing clinically apparent liver injury, but the role of glucosamine as opposed to other herbal components or contaminants has not been shown, and liver injury due to glucosamine or chondroitin must be very rare if it occurs at all.
