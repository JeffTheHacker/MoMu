it is a member of the class of pyrimidone, which is (as the monohydrate of its sodium salt) in combination with ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir (under the trade name Viekira Pak) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection as well as cirrhosis of the liver. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a nonnucleoside hepatitis C virus polymerase inhibitor. It is a member of naphthalenes, a sulfonamide, an aromatic ether and a pyrimidone. It derives from a uracil. it is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with potential activity against HCV. Upon administration and after intracellular uptake, it binds HCV NS5B polymerase and blocks viral RNA synthesis and replication. The HCV NS5B protein is essential for the replication of the HCV RNA genome. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family; HCV infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
