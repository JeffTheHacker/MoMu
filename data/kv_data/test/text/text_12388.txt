it is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of L-valine with (1R)-1-(6-fluoro-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)ethylamine and replacement of one of the hydrogens attached to the alpha-amino group by a carboxy group. It is the active form of the fungicide it isopropyl (in which the carbamic acid group has been converted to the corresponding isopropyl ester). It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is an organofluorine compound, a member of benzothiazoles, a carboxamide, a valine derivative, a valinamide fungicide and a benzothiazole fungicide.
