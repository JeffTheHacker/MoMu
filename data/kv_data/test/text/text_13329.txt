Arsenic trioxide is a chemotherapeutic agent of idiopathic function used to treat leukemia that is unresponsive to first line agents. It is suspected that arsenic trisulfide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. In general, arsenic is known to be a naturally toxic substance capable of eliciting a variety of dangerous adverse effects. The enzyme thioredoxin reductase has recently been identified as a target for arsenic trioxide.
