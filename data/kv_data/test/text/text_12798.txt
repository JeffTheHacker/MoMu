it is a water soluble, 5-nitroimidazole compound with antibacterial and potential radiosensitizing activity. As an oxygen mimetic, it induces free radical formation and is able to sensitize hypoxic cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. This prevents DNA repair and thus enhances damage to DNA strands; eventually, leading to tumor cell death. it is less active but also less toxic than the 2-nitroimidazole compounds, misonidazole and etanidazole.
