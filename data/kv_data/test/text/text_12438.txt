it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, it can be found in pulses. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
