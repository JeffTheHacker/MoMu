it is a sodium phosphate salt form of vidarabine, a nucleoside analog with activity against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. Vidarabine is converted to a monophosphate by viral thymidine kinase and is further modified to a triphosphate form by host enzymes. Vidarabine triphosphate directly inhibits DNA polymerase and also acts as a chain terminator in DNA replication.
