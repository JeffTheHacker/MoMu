Levofloxacin is a Quinolone Antimicrobial. The chemical classification of levofloxacin is Quinolones. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum, third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic and optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin with antibacterial activity. Levofloxacin diffuses through the bacterial cell wall and acts by inhibiting DNA gyrase (bacterial topoisomerase II), an enzyme required for DNA replication, RNA transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Inhibition of DNA gyrase activity leads to blockage of bacterial cell growth.
