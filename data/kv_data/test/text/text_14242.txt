N4-Hydroxyctidine, or EIDD-1931, is a ribonucleoside analog which induces mutations in RNA virions. it was first described in the literature in 1980 as a potent mutagen of bacteria and phage. It has shown antiviral activity against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and the human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 in vitro. N4-hydroxycytodine has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as well as other human and bat coronaviruses in mice and human airway epithelial cells. It is orally bioavailable in mice and distributes into tissue before becoming the active 5â-triphosphate form, which is incorporated into the genome of new virions, resulting in the accumulation of inactivating mutations. In non-human primates, it was poorly orally bioavailable. A [remdesivir] resistant mutant mouse hepatitis virus has also been shown to have increased sensitivity to it. The prodrug of it, [EIDD-2801], is also being investigated for its broad spectrum activity against the coronavirus family of viruses.
