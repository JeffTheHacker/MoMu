Diethyl acetic acid, also known as 2-ethyl-butyric acid or diethyl acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched fatty acids. These are fatty acids containing a branched chain. Diethyl acetic acid exists as a liquid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Diethyl acetic acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, diethyl acetic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome. Diethyl acetic acid has an acidic, berry, and caramel taste.
