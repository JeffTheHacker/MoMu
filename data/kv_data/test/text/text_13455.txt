2, 5-Dimethylthiophene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 5-disubstituted thiophenes. These are organic compounds containing a thiophene that is disubstituted at the C-2, and C5-positions. 2, 5-Dimethylthiophene exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 5-dimethylthiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 5-Dimethylthiophene is a nutty and sulfury tasting compound that can be found in garden onion and soft-necked garlic. This makes 2, 5-dimethylthiophene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
