Vulgarin, also known as tauremisin or barrelin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmanolides, secoeudesmanolides, and derivatives. These are terpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmanolide (a 3, 5a, 9-trimethyl-naphtho[1, 2-b]furan-2-one derivative) or secoeudesmanolide (a 3, 6-dimethyl-5-(pentan-2-yl)-1-benzofuran-2-one derivative) skeleton. Vulgarin exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, vulgarin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, vulgarin can be found in mugwort. This makes vulgarin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
