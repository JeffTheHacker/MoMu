(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-it is the all-cis-isomer of a C22 polyunsaturated fatty acid having five double bonds in the 7-, 10-, 13-, 16- and 19-positions. It has a role as a human metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is a it and an omega-3 fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate. it is a polyunsaturated very long-chain fatty acid with a 22-carbon backbone and 5 double bonds, originating from the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th and 15th positions from the methyl end, with all double bonds in the cis- configuration.
