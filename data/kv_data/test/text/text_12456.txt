A carbapenem derivative antibacterial agent that is more stable to renal dehydropeptidase I than IMIPENEM, but does not need to be given with an enzyme inhibitor such as CILASTATIN. It is used in the treatment of infections such as HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA, and complicated intra-abdominal or urinary-tract infections, including PYELONEPHRITIS.
