it, also known as macc, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl-l-alpha-amino acids. These are n-acylated alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid can be found in cereals and cereal products and garden tomato. This makes 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
