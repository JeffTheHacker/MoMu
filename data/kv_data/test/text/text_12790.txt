Narirutin, also known as isonaringenin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid-7-o-glycosides. These are phenolic compounds containing a flavonoid moiety which is O-glycosidically linked to carbohydrate moiety at the C7-position. Narirutin exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, narirutin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Narirutin is a bland tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine), peppermint, pummelo, and lime. This makes narirutin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
