it is a dipeptide, a dithioketal, an azaspiro compound, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, an ethyl ester, a tertiary carboxamide, a secondary amino compound and a pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid. It has a role as a prodrug, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It derives from a itat. it is a prodrug and non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it is converted in the body to its active metabolite itat. itat competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. itat also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
