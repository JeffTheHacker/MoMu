it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolidinecarboxamides. These are pyrrolidines in which the pyrrolidine rings is substituted at one or more positions by a carboxamide group. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one nitrogen atom and four carbon atoms. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
