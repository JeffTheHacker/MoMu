it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Pain, Neoplasms, and Chronic Pain. it is an orally available benzenoid that acts as an opioid peptide receptor agonist for the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor (opioid receptor like -1; OPRL1; ORL-1; NOP; kappa-type 3 opioid receptor) and the classical opioid receptors, mu, delta and kappa, with potential anti-nociceptive activity. Upon oral administration, it binds to NOP and the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors, which enhances NOP- and opioid receptor-mediated signaling, interferes with the sensation of pain and results in an analgesic effect. NOP, a member of the opioid receptor family, and its endogenous ligand nociceptin play key roles in the regulation of various brain activities including pain, and some inflammatory and immune responses.
