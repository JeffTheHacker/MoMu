it is the sodium salt form of cefuroxime and a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum, beta-lactamase resistant, second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by inactivating penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) thereby interfering with the final transpeptidation step required for cross-linking of peptidoglycan units which are a component of the cell wall. Lack of cross-linking results in a reduction of cell wall stability and leads to cell lysis.
