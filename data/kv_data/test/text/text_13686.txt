it is a 3-[1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl)ethoxy]-5-[1-(piperidin-4-yl)pyrazol-4-yl]pyridin-2-amine that has R configuration at the chiral centre. The active enantiomer, it acts as a kinase inhibitor and is used for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a biomarker and an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is an enantiomer of an ent-it. it is an orally available aminopyridine-based inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) with antineoplastic activity. it, in an ATP-competitive manner, binds to and inhibits ALK kinase and ALK fusion proteins. In addition, it inhibits c-Met kinase, and disrupts the c-Met signaling pathway. Altogether, this agent inhibits tumor cell growth. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors.
