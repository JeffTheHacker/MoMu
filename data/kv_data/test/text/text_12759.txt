it is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid. It is a member of n-3 PUFA and a product of alpha-linolenoic acid metabolism. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(4-).
