Pitavastatin is a relatively newly developed cholesterol lowering agent (statin) that is associated with mild, asymptomatic and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, but has had limited use and has yet to be linked with clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is a calcium salt formulation of pitavastatin, a novel statin that induces plaque regression and elevates HDL-cholesterol levels.
