it is the tosylate salt of bretylium. It blocks noradrenaline release from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and is used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. It has a role as an adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug and an antihypertensive agent. It is a quaternary ammonium salt and an organosulfonate salt. It contains a bretylium. it is the tosylate salt form of bretylium, a quaternary ammonium salt and non-selective adrenergic neuronal blocking agent with anti-arrhythmic properties. it is selectively taken up into peripheral nerve terminals and initially causes a release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings, thereby causing a sympathomimetic effect. This is followed by a prolonged anti-adrenergic action which prevents further discharge of neurotransmitter from sympathetic nerve endings. Its myocardial effects include a prolongation of action potential as well as refractory period. This drug is used to treat and suppress ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.
