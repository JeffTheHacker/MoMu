2, 8-Bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid, also known as 2, 8-MMQ or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quinoline carboxylic acids. These are quinolines in which the quinoline ring system is substituted by a carboxyl group at one or more positions. 2, 8-Bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 2, 8-Bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 2, 8-bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
