Mitobronitol is a brominated analog of mannitol with potential antineoplastic activity. Mitobronitol most likely acts through alkylation via derived epoxide groups. Mitolactol is a synthetic derivative of hexitol with antineoplastic and radiosensitizing properties. Mitolactol alkylates DNA via actual or derived epoxide groups, resulting in inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis. (NCI04)
