it is a propanolamine that is 1-(propan-2-ylamino)propan-2-ol substituted by a 4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxy group at position 1. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an antihypertensive agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a propanolamine, an aromatic ether, a secondary alcohol and a secondary amino compound. it is a cardioselective competitive beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with antihypertensive properties and devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. it antagonizes beta 1-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, thereby reducing the rate and force of myocardial contraction leading to a reduction in cardiac output. This agent may also reduce the secretion of renin with subsequent reduction in levels of angiotensin II thereby preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.
