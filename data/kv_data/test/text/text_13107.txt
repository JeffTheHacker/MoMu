Tomatidine, also known as it or soladulcidine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as spirosolanes and derivatives. These are steroidal alkaloids with a structure containing a spirosolane skeleton. Siporosolane is a polycyclic compound that is characterized by a 1-oxa-6-azaspiro[4. 5]decane moiety where the oxolane ring is fused to a docosahydronaphth[2, 1:4', 5']indene ring system. Spirosolane arises from the conversion of a cholestane side-chain into a bicyclic system containing a piperidine and a tetrahydrofuran ring. Tomatidine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Tomatidine has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, tomatidine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, tomatidine can be found in garden tomato, garden tomato (var. ), and potato. This makes tomatidine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
