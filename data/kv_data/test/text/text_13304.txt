11-Hydroxy-delta-9-THC, also known as 11-hydroxy-Î-9-thc, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 2-dimethyl-1-benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a 1-benzopyran moiety that carries two methyl groups at the 2-position. 11-Hydroxy-delta-9-THC is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 11-Hydroxy-delta-9-THC has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
