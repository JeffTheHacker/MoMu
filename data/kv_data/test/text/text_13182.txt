Pentanoyl-CoA belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl coas. These are acyl-CoAs carrying a 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl chain. Pentanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Pentanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, pentanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Pentanoyl-CoA can be biosynthesized from 3-hydroxyvalproic acid CoA through its interaction with the enzyme trifunctional enzyme, mitochondrial. In humans, pentanoyl-CoA is involved in the valproic Acid metabolism pathway.
