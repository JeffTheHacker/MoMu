1, 1-Dimethylethyl heptanoic acid, also known as tert-butyl heptanoic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. 1, 1-Dimethylethyl heptanoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 1, 1-Dimethylethyl heptanoic acid has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and urine. Within the cell, 1, 1-dimethylethyl heptanoic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
