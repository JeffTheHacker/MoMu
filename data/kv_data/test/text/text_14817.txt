Oxidized glutathione, also known as glutathione disulfide or GSSG, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligopeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of between three and ten alpha-amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Oxidized glutathione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Oxidized glutathione has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as saliva, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, oxidized glutathione is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Oxidized glutathione exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Oxidized glutathione participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Oxidized glutathione can be converted into glutathione; which is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione reductase, mitochondrial. In addition, Oxidized glutathione can be biosynthesized from glutathione through the action of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1. In humans, oxidized glutathione is involved in the trisalicylate-choline action pathway, the piroxicam action pathway, the salsalate action pathway, and the oxaprozin action pathway. Oxidized glutathione is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome pathway, 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, and leukotriene C4 synthesis deficiency.
