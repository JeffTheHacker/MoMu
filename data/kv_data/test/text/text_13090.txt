it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthones. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a xanthene moiety conjugated to a ketone group at carbon 9. Xanthene is a tricyclic compound made up of two benzene rings linearly fused to each other through a pyran ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
