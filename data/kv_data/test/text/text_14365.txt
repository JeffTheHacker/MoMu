it is a dicarboximide resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of 4-(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-methoxypropan-2-yl)-3-isobutylaniline with isobutyric acid and with 1,3,5-trimethylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. Developed by Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. (Japan), it is a pro-acaricide, with its metabolite (the -NH form lacking the isubutanoyl group) exhibiting high activity on mitochondrial complex II. It has been reported to be very effective in controlling spider mites (Tetranychus, Oligonychus, and Panonychus species) during all life stages. It is a member of pyrazoles, a dicarboximide, an organofluorine acaricide and an ether.
