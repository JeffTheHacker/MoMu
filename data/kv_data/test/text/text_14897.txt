Di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide, also known as dially tetrasulfide or 4, 5, 6, 7-tetrathia-1, 9-decadiene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as allyl sulfur compounds. Allyl sulfur compounds are compounds containing an allylsulfur group, with the general structure H2C(=CH2)CS. Di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide is a strong, garlic, and onion tasting compound that can be found in garlic, onion-family vegetables, and soft-necked garlic. This makes di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
