it, also known as it or acetoxypropanone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha-acyloxy ketones. These are ketones that have an acyloxy substituent alpha to the carbonyl group. They have the general structure R4C(=O)OC(R2)(R3)C(R1)=O (R1=organyl, R4=H or organyl; R2, R3 = any atom). it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a buttery and fruity tasting compound that can be found in pineapple. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
