it, also known as 4-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1, 3-oxazole or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 4-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole can be found in cocoa and cocoa products and nuts. This makes 4-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
