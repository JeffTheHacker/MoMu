it is a prednisolone compound having an alpha-chloro substituent at the 7-position, an alpha-methyl substituent at the 16-position and O-propanoyl groups at the 17- and 21-positions. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a 20-oxo steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, a steroid ester, a propanoate ester, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a chlorinated steroid. It derives from a prednisolone. it is the dipropionate salt form of alclometasone, a synthetic corticosteroid with low to medium potency. it is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist that mimics the metabolic, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects of natural glucocorticoids. This drug interacts with specific intracellular receptors and binds to DNA to modify gene expression. This results in an induction of synthesis of certain proteins while inhibiting the synthesis of others. it is used for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.
