L-Arginine, also known as L-arg, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as l-alpha-amino acids. These are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-Arginine is a drug which is used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance. L-Arginine exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). L-Arginine has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including feces, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. Within the cell, L-arginine is primarily located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and myelin sheath. L-Arginine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. L-Arginine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Glycine and L-arginine can be converted into guanidoacetic acid and orotidylic acid through its interaction with the enzyme glycine amidinotransferase, mitochondrial. Furthermore, Fumaric acid and L-arginine can be biosynthesized from argininosuccinic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Furthermore, L-Arginine can be converted into ornithine and urea through its interaction with the enzyme arginase-1. Finally, Fumaric acid and L-arginine can be biosynthesized from argininosuccinic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. In humans, L-arginine is involved in the aspartate metabolism pathway, the arginine and proline metabolism pathway, the transcription/translation pathway, and the glycine and serine metabolism pathway. L-Arginine is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the hypoacetylaspartia pathway, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, the hyperglycinemia, non-ketotic pathway, and the prolinemia type II pathway. Outside of the human body, L-arginine can be found in a number of food items such as avocado, black-eyed pea, squashberry, and chinese water chestnut. This makes L-arginine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. L-Arginine is a potentially toxic compound. L-Arginine has been found to be associated with several diseases known as heart failure, myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia 1, and hyperlysinuria; l-arginine has also been linked to several inborn metabolic disorders including propionic acidemia and cystinuria.
