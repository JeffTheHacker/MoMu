it is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-formyl-L-leucine with the hydroxy group of (3S,4S)-3-hexyl-4-[(2S)-2-hydroxytridecyl]oxetan-2-one. A pancreatic lipase inhibitor, it is used as an anti-obesity drug. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.3 (triacylglycerol lipase) inhibitor, a bacterial metabolite, an EC 2.3.1.85 (fatty acid synthase) inhibitor and an anti-obesity agent. It is a beta-lactone, a L-leucine derivative, a member of formamides and a carboxylic ester. it is a reversible active-site inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases. it forms a covalent bond with the active serine site in gastric and pancreatic lipases, thereby inhibiting their activity and preventing dietary fat from being hydrolyzed and absorbed.
