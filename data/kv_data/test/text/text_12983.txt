it is an ether that is the 2-acetyl-4-(butanoylamino)phenyl ether of the primary hydroxy group of 3-(propan-2-ylamino)propane-1,2-diol. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an antihypertensive agent and a sympathomimetic agent. It is a member of ethanolamines, a propanolamine, a secondary amino compound, an ether, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an aromatic amide. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a synthetic butyranilide derivative with hypotensive and antiarrhythmic activity. it acts as a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on bronchial receptors and has intrinsic sympathomimetic properties. Having stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm, it is used in ventricular arrhythmias. Other indications include hypertension, alone or in combinations with other agents.
