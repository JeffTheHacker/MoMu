it is a hydroxamic acid ester that is benzhydroxamic acid (N-hydroxybenzamide) in which the hydroxamic acid group has been converted to the corresponding 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester and in which the benzene ring has been substituted at position 2 by a (2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino group and at positions 3 and 4 by fluorines (the R enantiomer). It has a role as an EC 2.7.12.2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a hydroxamic acid ester, a secondary amino compound, a member of monofluorobenzenes, an organoiodine compound, a member of propane-1,2-diols and a difluorobenzene. MEK Inhibitor it is an orally bioavailable, synthetic organic molecule targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK/ERK kinase or MEK) with potential antineoplastic activity. MEK inhibitor PD325901, a derivative of MEK inhibitor CI-1040, selectively binds to and inhibits MEK, which may result in the inhibition of the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK/ERK and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. The dual specific threonine/tyrosine kinase MEK is a key component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that is frequently activated in human tumors.
