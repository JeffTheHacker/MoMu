it is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the therapy of hypertension and heart failure. it is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury. it is a phosphinic acid-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As an ester prodrug, it is hydrolysed by esterases to its active metabolite itat. itat specifically and competitively inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme thereby decreasing the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, resulting in diminished vasopressor activity. In addition, angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion by adrenal cortex is decreased, which results in a decrease of sodium retention and an increase in water outflow.
