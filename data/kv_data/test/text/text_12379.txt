it has been used in trials studying the supportive care and treatment of Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia. Mosedipimod is a synthetic version of a monoacetyldiacylglyceride naturally occurring in various seed oils, bovine udder and milk fat, antlers of sika deer, with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action through which it exerts its pharmacological effect has yet to be fully identified, upon administration, mosedipimod stimulates calcium influx into T-lymphocytes and increases the production of various cytokines, including interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-g), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells and immune cells, including T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Therefore, EC18 may stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. In addition, it enhances the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and suppresses the expression of the transmembrane protein tumor cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) on cancer cells. As activation of TLR-4 enhances immunosuppression and stimulates cancer cell growth, blocking TLR-4 expression suppresses tumor cell proliferation.
