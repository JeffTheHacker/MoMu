Norcisapride belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminobenzamides. These are organic compounds containing a benzamide moiety with an amine group attached to the benzene ring. Norcisapride is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Norcisapride has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, norcisapride is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
