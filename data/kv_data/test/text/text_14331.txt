it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkaloids and derivatives. These are naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms. This group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly acidic properties. Also some synthetic compounds of similar structure are attributed to alkaloids. In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and more rarely other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus. it is soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, homoarecoline is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, homoarecoline can be found in nuts. This makes homoarecoline a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
