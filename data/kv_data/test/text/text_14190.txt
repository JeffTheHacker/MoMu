6-Acetylmorphine, also known as it CPD or morphine-6-acetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic. 6-Acetylmorphine is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). 6-Acetylmorphine has been primarily detected in blood. In humans, 6-acetylmorphine is involved in the heroin action pathway and the heroin metabolism pathway.
