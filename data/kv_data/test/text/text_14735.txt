2,2'-iminobis[1-(6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-2-yl)ethanol] is a member of the class of chromanes that is 2,2'-iminodiethanol in which one hydrogen attached to each hydroxy-bearing carbon is replaced by a 6-fluorochroman-2-yl group. It is an organofluorine compound, a secondary amino compound, a secondary alcohol, a diol and a member of chromanes. it is a beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with antihypertensive and vasodilatory activity. it binds to and blocks the beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, thereby decreasing cardiac contractility and rate. This leads to a reduction in cardiac output and lowers blood pressure. In addition, nebivolol potentiates nitric oxide (NO), thereby relaxing vascular smooth muscle and exerting a vasodilatory effect.
