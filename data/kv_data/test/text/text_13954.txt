it is a syrbactin that has a (3E,9E)-2,7-dioxo-1,6-diazacyclododeca-3,9-diene skeleton that is substituted by an isopropyl group at position 5 and by a [(2S)-2-({[(1S)-1-carboxy-2-methylpropyl]carbamoyl}amino)-3-methylbutanoyl]nitrilo group at the 8-pro-S position. It is produced by the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of ureas, a monocarboxylic acid, a syrbactin and a homodetic cyclic peptide.
