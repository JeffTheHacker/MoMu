it, also known as hishigado or amgard CPC, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as psoralens. These are organic compounds containing a psoralen moiety, which consists of a furan fused to a chromenone to for 7H-furo[3, 2-g]chromen-7-one it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (R)-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (R)-it can be found in carrot, lemon, parsley, and wild carrot. This makes (R)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
