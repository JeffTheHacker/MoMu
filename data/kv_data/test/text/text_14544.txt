it is an imidazoquinoxaline that is 3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline substituted at positions 3 and 8 by methyl groups and at position 2 by an amino group. A mutagenic compound found in cooked beef. It has a role as a mutagen, a carcinogenic agent, a genotoxin and a Maillard reaction product. It is an imidazoquinoxaline and an aromatic amine. it is a synthetic, pale orange to brown crystalline solid that is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide and methanol. It is produced in small quantities for research purposes. it is formed naturally during the cooking of muscle-derived foods (meat and fish). Levels of this chemical produced in this manner are dependent on cooking temperature, cooking time and method of cooking (direct or indirect). It is one of the most abundant heterocyclic amines in a typical Western diet. it has also been detected in processed food flavorings, beer, wine, and cigarette smoke. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
