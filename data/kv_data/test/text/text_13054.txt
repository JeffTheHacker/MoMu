it is a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative that is butanamide in which the pro-S hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a (4R)-2-oxo-4-propylpyrrolidin-1-yl. Used for treatment of partial onset seizures related to epilepsy. It has a role as an anticonvulsant. It is a gamma-lactam and a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative. It derives from a L-alpha-aminobutyric acid. it is an orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity. Although the exact mechanism through which it exerts its effects is not fully known, this agent targets and binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in the brain. This prevents synaptic vesicle exocytosis and the synaptic release of certain, as of yet not fully known, excitatory neurotransmitters. This may inhibit impulse conduction across synapses, decrease neuronal (hyper-)excitability, and may modulate epileptogenesis. SV2A, a membrane glycoprotein present in neuronal synaptic vesicles, plays a key role in action potential-induced neurotransmitter release in the brain.
