it is a colorless liquid with a strong acid odor. Denser than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence sinks in water. (USCG, 1999) it is a synthetic, colorless to light yellow liquid that is soluble in polar organic solvents and only slightly soluble in water. it is used as both a chemical intermediate and cross-linking agent in the production of polymers. it is flammable and, when heated to decomposition, emits toxic fumes of hydrogen chloride. Exposure of humans to it vapor causes irritation of the eyes and throat. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
