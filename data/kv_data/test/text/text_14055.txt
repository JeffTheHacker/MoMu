it is a secondary amino compound formally derived from ammonia by replacing two of the hydrogens by 2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl and 4-phenylbutan-2-yl groups. It is an adrenergic antagonist used to treat high blood pressure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a sympatholytic agent, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and a beta-adrenergic antagonist. It is a member of benzamides and a secondary amino compound. it is a third generation selective alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist and non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with vasodilatory and antihypertensive properties. it competitively binds to alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle, thereby inhibiting the adrenergic stimulation of endothelial cell function and vasoconstriction in peripheral blood vessels. This agent also binds to beta-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in adrenergic stimulation. The result is a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates, cardiac output, and in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, thereby resulting in vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects.
