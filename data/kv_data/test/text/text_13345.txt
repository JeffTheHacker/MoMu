it is a proprietary 44-nucleotide L-stereoisomer RNA oligonucleotide conjugated to a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) that targets hepcidin with potential anti-anemic activity. Upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, lexaptepid pegol binds to hepcidin and prevents it from binding to the iron channel ferroportin, located on the basolateral surface of gastrointestinal enterocytes and the plasma membrane of macrophages. This prevents hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of ferroportin, thus decreasing macrophage iron retention. In turn, binding of NOX-H94 to hepcidin normalizes plasma iron levels and increases erythropoiesis. This may inhibit anemia caused by inflammation. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the homeostasis of systemic iron, is upregulated during acute and chronic inflammation in response to cytokines. The unique mirror-image configuration of this agent renders it resistant to hydrolysis and shows a low antigenicity profile. Pegylation increases the half-life of this agent. it is a 45-mer L-stereoisomer RNA oligonucleotide linked to a 40 kDa polyethyleneglycol that targets the small chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) with potential antineoplastic and hematopoietic stem cell-mobilization activities. SDF-1 targeted agent NOX-A12 specifically binds to SDF-1 thereby preventing the binding of SDF-1 to its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 blocking the subsequent receptor activation. This may prevent angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis and could sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. In addition, inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into blood. The unique mirror-image configuration of this agent renders it resistant to hydrolysis and does not hybridize with native nucleic acids. Furthermore, this agent does not induce the innate immune response and has shown a favorable immunogenicity profile.
