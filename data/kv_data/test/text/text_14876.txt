TG(22:0/22:0/22:0), also known as it or ato 888, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triacylglycerols. These are glycerides consisting of three fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Thus, TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) is considered to be a triradylglycerol lipid molecule. TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) has been found in human adipose tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and adiposome. TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) can be biosynthesized from DG(22:0/22:0/0:0) and docosanoyl-CoA through its interaction with the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase. In humans, TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) is involved in the metabolic disorder called de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(22:0/22:0/22:0) pathway.
