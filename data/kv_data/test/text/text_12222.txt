Alpha-Terpineol propanoate, also known as a-terpineol propanoic acid or p-menth-1-en-8-yl propionate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. Alpha-Terpineol propanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-terpineol propanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Alpha-Terpineol propanoate is a bitter, citrus, and geranium tasting compound that can be found in lemon and wild celery. This makes Alpha-terpineol propanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
