2, 4-Dimethyl-5-propyloxazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. 2, 4-Dimethyl-5-propyloxazole is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, 2, 4-dimethyl-5-propyloxazole can be found in crustaceans, nuts, and potato. This makes 2, 4-dimethyl-5-propyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
