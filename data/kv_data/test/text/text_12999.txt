it is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid that is testosterone in which the hydrogen at position 17 is replaced by an ethynyl group and in which the methyl group attached to position 10 is replaced by hydrogen. It has a role as a synthetic oral contraceptive and a progestin. It is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, a terminal acetylenic compound, a tertiary alcohol and a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid. It derives from a hydride of an estrane. it is a synthetic progestational substance with some anabolic, estrogenic, and androgenic properties. it binds to the progesterone intracellular receptors in the reproductive system and the resultant activated complex interacts with specific DNA sites. This leads to an alteration in protein synthesis and results in an inhibition of LH release. Consequently, it inhibits ovulation and changes the normal cycle of cervical mucus and endometrium.
