it is an oxime O-ether that is the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl ether of the oxime obtained by formal condensation of hydroxylamine with the carbonyl group of acetopnenone in which the phenyl group is substituted by chlorines at positions 2 and 4, and in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group is replaced by a 1H-imidazol-1-yl group. An antifungal agent, it is used (generally as the nitrate salt) in creams and powders for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections. It has a role as an antiinfective agent. It is a member of imidazoles, an oxime O-ether, a dichlorobenzene, an imidazole antifungal drug and a conazole antifungal drug. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a broad spectrum imidazole derivative with antifungal activity. Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, it, like other azole antifungals, most likely inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent demethylation of lanosterol. This prevents the synthesis of ergosterol which is a crucial component of fungal cell membrane. By disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis and integrity, it alters fungal cell membrane permeability, promotes loss of essential intracellular components and eventually inhibits fungal cell growth.
