it is a synthetic non-halogenated double-ester derivative of the corticosteroid prednisolone with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. Following skin permeation, it enters cells and binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by increasing the expression of lipocortins. These block phospholipase A-dependent release of arachidonic acid thereby inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes by suppression of the production of vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide.
