it, also known as 1-formyl-piperidine or FPI, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as piperidines. Piperidines are compounds containing a piperidine ring, which is a saturated aliphatic six-member ring with one nitrogen atom and five carbon atoms. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-piperidinecarboxaldehyde is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-piperidinecarboxaldehyde can be found in herbs and spices and pepper (spice). This makes 1-piperidinecarboxaldehyde a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
