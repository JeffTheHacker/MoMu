S-(2-Aminoethyl)-L-cysteine, also known as 4-it or thiosine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cysteine and derivatives. Cysteine and derivatives are compounds containing cysteine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of cysteine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. S-(2-Aminoethyl)-L-cysteine is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine can be found in mushrooms. This makes S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
