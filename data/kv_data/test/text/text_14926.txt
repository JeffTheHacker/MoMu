Stevioside, also known as eupatorin? or rebaudin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steviol glycosides. These are prenol lipids containing a carbohydrate moiety glycosidically linked to a steviol (a diterpenoid based on a 13-Hydroxykaur-16-en-18-oic acid) moiety. Stevioside exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, stevioside is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
