Na, na-dimethylhistamine, also known as hippospongine?, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group. Na, na-dimethylhistamine is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, na, na-dimethylhistamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, na, na-dimethylhistamine can be found in mushrooms, pomes, and spinach. This makes na, na-dimethylhistamine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
