3, 5, 7-Trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one, also known as dihydro-kempferol or aromadendrin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavanonols. Flavanonols are compounds containing a flavan-3-one moiety, with a structure characterized by a 2-phenyl-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran bearing a hydroxyl group and a ketone at the carbon C2 and C3, respectively. 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Outside of the human body, 3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one can be found in european plum and tea. This makes 3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
