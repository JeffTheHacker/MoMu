it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta-diketones. These are organic compounds containing two keto groups separated by a single carbon atom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, tsibulin 1 is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, tsibulin 1 can be found in garden onion and onion-family vegetables. This makes tsibulin 1 a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
