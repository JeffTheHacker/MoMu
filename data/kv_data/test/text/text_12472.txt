2-Propenyl hexanoate, also known as it or allocopen, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. 2-Propenyl hexanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 2-Propenyl hexanoate has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-propenyl hexanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 2-Propenyl hexanoate is a sweet, arrack, and cognac tasting compound that can be found in fruits, mushrooms, and potato. This makes 2-propenyl hexanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
