Haloperidol 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. Haloperidol 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Haloperidol 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, haloperidol 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
