it is an odorless yellow to orange-brown crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992)  It is a chemotherapy drug that interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis. it is a member of pteridines, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a dicarboxylic acid. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antirheumatic drug, an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, an abortifacient, a dermatologic drug, an antimetabolite and an immunosuppressive agent. It derives from a L-glutamic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is an antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. it binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. it also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
