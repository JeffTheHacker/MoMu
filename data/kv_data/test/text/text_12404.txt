it is an N-[2-hydroxy-5-(1-hydroxy-2-{[1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-yl]amino}ethyl)phenyl]formamide in which both of the stereocentres have R configuration. The active enantiomer of it, it is administered by inhalation (generally as the tartrate salt) as a direct-acting sympathomimetic and bronchodilator for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (any progressive respiratory disease that makes it harder to breathe over time, such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema). It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, an anti-asthmatic drug and a beta-adrenergic agonist. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (S,S)-it. Formoterol Fumarate is the fumarate salt form of it, a long-acting and selective sympathomimetic beta-receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol fumarate binds beta 2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase, thereby increasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, improve mucociliary clearance and reduce mediator substance release in inflammatory cells, especially from mast cells. (NCI05) it is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist and isomer of it with bronchodilator activity. it selectively binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchiolar smooth muscle, thereby causing stimulation of adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased intracellular cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and lead to a reduced release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. This may eventually lead to an improvement of airway function. it Tartrate is the tartrate salt of it, the (R,R)-enantiomer of it and a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist with bronchodilator activity. it selectively binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchiolar smooth muscle, thereby causing stimulation of adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased intracellular cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and lead to an inhibition of release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. This may eventually lead to an improvement of airway function. Formoterol is a long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol selectively binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, thereby activating intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, improve mucociliary clearance and reduce mediator substance release from inflammatory cells, especially from mast cells.
