it is a 5alpha-androstane compound having 3alpha-acetoxy-, 17beta-acetoxy-, 2beta-piperidino- and 16beta-N-methylpiperidinium substituents. It has a role as a nicotinic antagonist, a neuromuscular agent, a muscle relaxant and a drug allergen. It is an androstane, a quaternary ammonium ion and an acetate ester. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-androstane. it is a synthetic, intermediate-acting mono-quaternary steroid and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, with muscle relaxant activity. it competitively binds to and blocks the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing acetylcholine (ACh) binding and resulting in skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis. it has a shorter duration of action than pancuronium.
