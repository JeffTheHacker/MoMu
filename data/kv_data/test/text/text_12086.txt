1, 6-Hexanedithiol, also known as hexane-1, 6-dithiol or 1, 6-dimercaptohexane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkylthiols. These are organic compounds containing the thiol functional group linked to an alkyl chain. 1, 6-Hexanedithiol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 6-hexanedithiol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 1, 6-Hexanedithiol has a burnt, fatty, and meaty taste.
