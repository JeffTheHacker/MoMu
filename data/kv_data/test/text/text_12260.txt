Buprenorphine is a DEA Schedule III controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule III have a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I or II and abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. it is the hydrochloride salt form of buprenorphine, a synthetic phenanthrene with narcotic analgesic activity. it is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kapa-opioid receptor in the central nervous system. However, under the conditions of recommended use it behaves as a classic mu-opioid agonist, mimicking the actions of endogenous peptides at CNS opioid receptors. The agonist action results in a raised pain threshold and increased tolerance to pain. However, it also causes sedation, physical dependence, and respiratory depressant effects and decreases heart rate and blood pressure.
