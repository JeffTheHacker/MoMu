it is the L-enantiomer of it. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a human metabolite, an algal metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a pyruvate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a it and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a L-leucinium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-leucinate. It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is one of nine essential amino acids in humans (provided by food), it is important for protein synthesis and many metabolic functions. it contributes to regulation of blood-sugar levels; growth and repair of muscle and bone tissue; growth hormone production; and wound healing. it also prevents breakdown of muscle proteins after trauma or severe stress and may be beneficial for individuals with phenylketonuria. it is available in many foods and deficiency is rare.
