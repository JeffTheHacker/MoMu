it is a dimethyl 2,2'-(9,9',10,10'-tetrahydroxy-7,7'-dimethoxy-1,1'-dioxo-3,3',4,4'-tetrahydro-[6,6'-binaphtho[2,3-c]pyran]-3,3'-diyl)diacetate in which the the 3 and 3' positions (bearing the 2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl (CH2CO2Me) groups) both have S configuration, while the 6 and 6' positions (where the binaphthopyran units are linked) have Ra configuration (the M atropisomer). It has been isolated from the fungi Aspergillus viridinutans and the fungus Paecilomyces variotii derived from the inner tissues of the giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai. It has a role as a mycotoxin, an Aspergillus metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It derives from a semiviriditoxin.
