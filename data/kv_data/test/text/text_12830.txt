it appears as a white crystalline substance. Insoluble in water and denser than water. Contact may irritate skin, eyes and mucous membranes. May be toxic by ingestion. Used to make other chemicals. it is a member of the class of chlorobenzenes that is benzene in which all of the hydrogens are replaced by chlorines. An agricultural fungicide introduced in the mid-1940s and formerly used as a seed treatment, its use has been banned since 1984 under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. It has a role as a persistent organic pollutant, a carcinogenic agent and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of chlorobenzenes and an aromatic fungicide. it is a stable, white, crystalline chlorinated hydrocarbon that emits very toxic fumes of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition. it was used as a fungicide and was also used as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of dyes, synthesis of organic chemicals, rubber and in wood preservation. Prolonged oral exposure to this substance results in a liver disease with associated skin lesions. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on association between thyroid, liver and kidney cancer and oral exposure in animals.
