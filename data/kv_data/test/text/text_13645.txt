Enterolactone, also known as it or 2, 3-BHBB, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans. These are lignan compounds containing a 3, 4-dibenzyloxolan-2-one moiety. Enterolactone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Enterolactone has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, urine, and blood. Within the cell, enterolactone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Enterolactone is a potentially toxic compound.
