it is a thiocarbamate and squalene epoxidase inhibitor with antifungal activity. it inhibits fungal squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the synthesis of sterol which is essential for cell membrane integrity. By preventing ergosterol synthesis and causing accumulation of squalene, this agent increases cell membrane permeability, cell leakage and eventually cell lysis.
