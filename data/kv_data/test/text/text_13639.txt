it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as p-methoxybenzoic acids and derivatives. These are benzoic acids in which the hydrogen atom at position 4 of the benzene ring is replaced by a methoxy group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid can be found in evening primrose. This makes 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
