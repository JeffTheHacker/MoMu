it is an aminopyrimidine antibiotic whose structure consists of pyrimidine 2,4-diamine and 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene moieties linked by a methylene bridge. It has a role as an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a drug allergen, an antibacterial drug and a diuretic. It is a member of methoxybenzenes and an aminopyrimidine. it is a synthetic derivative of trimethoxybenzyl-pyrimidine with antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties. As a pyrimidine inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, it binds tightly to the bacterial enzyme, blocking the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid. The antibacterial activity of this agent is potentiated by sulfonamides. (NCI04)
