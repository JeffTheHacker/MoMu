it is a member of the class of pyrazoles that is N-[4-(pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl]glycinamide in which the pyrazole ring is substituted at positions 3 and 5 by trifluoromethyl and phenanthrene-2-yl groups respectively. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a member of pyrazoles, a member of phenanthrenes, an organofluorine compound, a glycine derivative, an aromatic amide and an antibiotic antifungal drug. it is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule, celecoxib-derived inhibitor of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) with potential antineoplastic activity. Devoid of any COX inhibiting activity, it binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1).; subsequently, the phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B or PKB) is inhibited, which may result in inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, this agent appears to induce the activity of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), which plays a key role in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Activation and dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and dysregulated PI3K/Akt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.
