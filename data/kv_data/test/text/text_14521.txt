The glycopeptide antibiotics are semisynthetic macromolecules that are structurally related to vancomycin and have antibacterial activity against several gram positive organisms including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Three lipoglycopeptide antibiotics are available for use in the United States: dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin. All three agents have been associated with transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but they have yet to be linked convincingly to cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury.
