it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxazolidinones. Oxazolidinones are compounds containing an oxazolidinone moiety, which is an oxazolidine bearing a ketone group. it is very soluble (in water) and a strong basic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 3-amino-2-oxazolidone is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
