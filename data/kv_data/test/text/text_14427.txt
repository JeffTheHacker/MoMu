N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]propan-1-amine is an aromatic ether consisting of 4-trifluoromethylphenol in which the hydrogen of the phenolic hydroxy group is replaced by a 3-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropyl group. It is a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, an aromatic ether and a secondary amino compound. it is a diphenhydramine derivative and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant, anti-anxiety, antiobsessional and antibulimic activity and with potential immunomodulating activity. Upon administration, it binds to the presynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptor resulting in negative allosteric modulation of the receptor complex, thereby blocking recycling of serotonin by the presynaptic receptor. Inhibition of serotonin reuptake by it enhances serotonergic function through serotonin accumulation in the synaptic space, resulting in long-term desensitization and downregulation of 5-HT receptors, preventing 5-HT-mediated signaling and leading to antidepressant, anti-anxiety, antiobsessional and antibulimic effects. In addition, it may inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). This may prevent IL-6-mediated inflammation and cytokine storm.
