Dolasetron is a member of quinolizines, a member of indoles and a heteroarenecarboxylate ester. Dolasetron is an indole derivative and a potent serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with anti-emetic property. Dolasetron blocks the activity of serotonin released from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by selectively inhibiting and inactivating 5-HT3 receptors located on the nerve terminals of the vagus nerve in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. This results in suppression of signalling to trigger chemo- and radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
