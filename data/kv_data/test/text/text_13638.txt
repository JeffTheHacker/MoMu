it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 7-o-methylated isoflavonoids. These are isoflavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C7 atom of the isoflavonoid backbone. Isoflavonoids are natural products derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in pigeon pea and pulses. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
