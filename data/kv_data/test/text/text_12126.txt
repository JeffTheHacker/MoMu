it is the hydrochloride salt form of fexofenadine, a carboxylated metabolic derivative of terfenadine and second generation, long-lasting selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, with antihistaminic activity. Upon administration, fexofenadine competitively binds of peripheral H1-receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This prevents binding of histamine to peripheral H1-receptors and prevents their activation. This prevents a histamine-mediated allergic reaction. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).
