Nebularine, also known as N-D-it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purine nucleosides. Purine nucleosides are compounds comprising a purine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl moiety. Nebularine exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, nebularine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, nebularine can be found in mushrooms. This makes nebularine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
