it is a member of the class of indole-3-acetic acids that is indole-3-acetic acid in which the indole ring is substituted at positions 1, 2 and 5 by p-chlorobenzoyl, methyl, and methoxy groups, respectively. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it is used in the treatment of musculoskeletal and joint disorders including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, bursitis and tendinitis. It has a role as an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an analgesic, a gout suppressant, a drug metabolite, a xenobiotic metabolite, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is a N-acylindole, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an aromatic ether and a member of indole-3-acetic acids. it is a synthetic nonsteroidal indole derivative with anti-inflammatory activity and chemopreventive properties. As a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing cyclooxygenase-mediated DNA adduct formation by heterocyclic aromatic amines. This agent also may inhibit the expression of multidrug-resistant protein type 1, resulting in increased efficacies of some antineoplastic agents in treating multi-drug resistant tumors. In addition, it activates phosphatases that inhibit the migration and proliferation of cancer cells and downregulates survivin, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis. (NCI04)
