it, also known as UDP xylose or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrimidine ribonucleoside diphosphates. These are pyrimidine ribonucleotides with diphosphate group linked to the ribose moiety. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found throughout all human tissues. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, mitochondria and cytoplasm. it can be biosynthesized from uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase 1. In humans, it is involved in the nucleotide sugars metabolism pathway. it is also involved in a couple of metabolic disorders, which include the galactosemia II (galk) pathway and the galactosemia III pathway.
