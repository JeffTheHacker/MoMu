it is a prodrug of etilefrine, an adrenergic agonist with vasoconstrictive activity. it is hydrolyzed to etilefrine, which binds to and activates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature. This causes smooth muscle contraction and leads to a decrease in venous pooling and increase in blood pressure. This agent may also stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors leading to positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.
