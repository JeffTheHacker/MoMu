it has been used in trials studying the treatment and health services research of Tumor, Food Effect, Gastric Cancer, Health Subjects, and Colorectal Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to and inhibits the activation of c-Met in an ATP-competitive manner, and disrupts c-Met signal transduction pathways. This may result in cell growth inhibition in tumors that overexpress the c-Met protein. C-Met encodes the hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis; this protein is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancers.
