N-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide is a member of the class of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes that is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile in which one of the amino hydrogens is substituted by a 3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoyl group. It is a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a nitrile, a sulfone and a tertiary alcohol. it is a synthetic, nonsteroidal antiandrogen. it competitively binds to cytosolic androgen receptors in target tissues, thereby inhibiting the receptor binding of androgens. This agent does not bind to most mutated forms of androgen receptors. (NCI04)
