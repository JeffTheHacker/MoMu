it is an enoate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of angelic acid with the hydroxy group of (1R,2R,7S,8aR)-1,8a-dimethyl-6-oxo-7-(prop-1-en-2-yl)-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-2-ol. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a vasodilator agent, an anti-allergic agent and an EC 2.7.11.31 {[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} activator. It is a sesquiterpenoid, an enone, an alicyclic ketone and an enoate ester. It derives from an angelic acid.
