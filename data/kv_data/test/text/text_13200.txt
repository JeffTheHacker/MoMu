Homocysteine thiolactone, also known as ( -)-3-amino-2-thiolanon, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof. Homocysteine thiolactone is soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Homocysteine thiolactone has been primarily detected in blood.
