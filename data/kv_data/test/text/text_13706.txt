it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trichothecenes. These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzopyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetyl, or other substituents. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12, 13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 15-deacetylcalonectrin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). it is a potentially toxic compound.
