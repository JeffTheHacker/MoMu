it is a cephalosporin bearing methyl and (2R)-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido groups at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the cephem skeleton. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is the anhydrous form of it, a semisynthetic first-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
