it is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which one of the nitrogens has been substituted by a 5-tert-butyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl group, while the other has been substituted by a 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl group, the hydroxy group has been converted to the corresponding 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yl ether. It is an FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3)and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibitor. It has a role as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a Wnt signalling inhibitor. It is a member of phenylureas, a pyrazolopyrimidine, an aromatic ether, a member of isoxazoles and a member of monofluorobenzenes.
