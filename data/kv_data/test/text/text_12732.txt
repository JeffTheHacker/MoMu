it is a member of indoles, a carbamate ester and a N-sulfonylcarboxamide. It has a role as an anti-asthmatic agent and a leukotriene antagonist. it is a tolyl compound and leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), with anti-asthmatic and potential capsular contracture-preventing activities. Upon administration, it selectively and competitively binds to and blocks the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor (CYSLTR1), thereby preventing the potent pro-inflammatory mediators leukotriene C4, D4 and E4 from binding. This prevents leukotriene-mediated actions, including enhanced migration of eosinophils and neutrophils, increased adhesion of leukocytes, increased monocyte and neutrophil aggregation, increased airway edema, inflammation, capillary permeability and bronchoconstriction. In addition, it may decrease collagen deposition, fibrosis, and capsular thickness after implantation, thereby preventing scar tissue.
