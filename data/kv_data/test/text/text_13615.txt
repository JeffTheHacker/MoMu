Dabigatran etexilate methanesulfonate is a methanesulfonate salt obtained by reaction of dabigatran etexilate with one equivalent of dabigatran etexilate. A prodrug for dabigatran, a thrombin inhibitor and anticoagulant which is used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. It has a role as an EC 3.4.21.5 (thrombin) inhibitor, an anticoagulant and a prodrug. It contains a dabigatran etexilate(1+). Dabigatran Etexilate Mesylate is an orally available mesylate salt form of the etexilate prodrug of dabigatran, a benzimidazole and direct thrombin inhibitor with anticoagulant activity. Upon administration, dabigatran etexilate is hydrolyzed by esterases and is converted into dabigatran. Dabigatran reversibly binds to and inhibits the activity of thrombin, a serine protease that converts fibrinogen into fibrin. This disrupts the coagulation cascade and inhibits the formation of blood clots.
