it is a phenolic analogue of tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). it competitively inhibits the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors, thereby preventing the receptor from binding to the estrogen-response element on DNA. The result is a reduction in DNA synthesis and cellular response to estrogen. (NCI)
