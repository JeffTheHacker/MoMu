it is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid resulting from the formal oxidative dimerisation of 4-{[(1R)-6,7-dimethoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl]methyl}phenol by attachment of the phenolic oxygen of one molecule to the benzene ring of the second (ortho to the phenolic hydroxy group of the latter). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a tertiary amino compound, a member of phenols, an aromatic ether, a member of isoquinolines and a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid.
