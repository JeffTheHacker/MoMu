Di-it, also known as 2, 2'-dithiodi-thiophene or disulfide, 2-thienyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. Di-it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, di-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Di-it has an earthy, mushroom, and rubbery taste.
