it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Leukemia, Neoplasms, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, among others. it is a dihydropteridinone Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits Plk1, inducing selective G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells while causing reversible cell arrest at the G1 and G2 stage without apoptosis in normal cells. Plk1, named after the polo gene of Drosophila melanogaster, is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in regulating mitotic spindle function in a non-ATP competitive manner.
