Deltait, also known as Î´it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. Thus, Deltait is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule. Deltait is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Deltait has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, Deltait is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Deltait is an intensely, creamy, and earthy tasting compound that can be found in green vegetables. This makes Deltait a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
