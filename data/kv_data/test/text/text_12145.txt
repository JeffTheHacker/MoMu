it is the di-4-toluate ester of (+-)-N-tert-butylnoradrenaline (colterol). A pro-drug for colterol, a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist, it is used as its methanesulfonate salt for relief of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, an anti-asthmatic drug, a beta-adrenergic agonist and a prodrug. It is a member of ethanolamines, a carboxylic ester, a diester, a secondary amino compound and a secondary alcohol. it is a diester sympathomimetic amine with bronchodilator activity. As an ester prodrug, it is hydrolyzed by esterases to its active metabolite colterol (N-t-butylarterenol). Colterol selectively binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchiolar smooth muscle, thereby causing stimulation of adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased intracellular cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. This increases air flow and prevents bronchospasms and may eventually lead to an improvement of airway function.
