Avenacoside a belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. Avenacoside a is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Avenacoside a has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, avenacoside a is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, avenacoside a can be found in cereals and cereal products and oat. This makes avenacoside a a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
