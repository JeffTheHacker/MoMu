it is an amino nonasaccharide that is the linear hexasaccharide alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-beta-D-Man-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc in which the mannosyl residue nearest the reducing end has the branched trisaccharide alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Man-(1->6)]-alpha-D-Man attached at position 6. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, an amino nonasaccharide and a (Hex)6,7(HexNAc)2.
