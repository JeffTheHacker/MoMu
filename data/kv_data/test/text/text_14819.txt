it is a dibenzooxazepine compound having a chloro substituent at the 2-position and a piperazin-1-yl group at the 11-position. It has a role as an antidepressant, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, a dopaminergic antagonist and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. it is a tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class. it exerts its antidepressant effect by inhibiting the re-uptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser degree, of serotonin, at adrenergic nerve endings and blocks the response of dopamine receptors to dopamine. This drug is used to treat symptoms of depression and may cause tardive dyskinesia. it also binds to alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic receptors which accounts for many of the side effects seen with this agent.
