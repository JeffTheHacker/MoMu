it, also known as butyl isopropyl ketone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ketones. These are organic compounds in which a carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms R2C=O (neither R may be a hydrogen atom). Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it has a fruity, green, and leafy taste.
