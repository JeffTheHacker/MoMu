it is a tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It was approved by the FDA in August 2019 for use in the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumors. it's approved use is meant as a last line of therapy due to its accelerated approval based on early trial data. This therapy offers benefit over similar ALK inhibitors such as [alectinib], [ceritinib], and [lorlatinib] due to a wider range of targets. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases tropomyosin receptor kinases (Trk) A, B and C, C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it binds to and inhibits TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK. Inhibition of these kinases may result in a disruption of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1-, and ALK-mediated signaling. This leads to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in tumor cells that express these kinases. TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types.
