4, 5-Dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole, also known as 2-iso-propyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole or 4, 5-dimethyl-2-isopropyloxazole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. 4, 5-Dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole can be found in cocoa and cocoa products, coffee and coffee products, nuts, and potato. This makes 4, 5-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)oxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
