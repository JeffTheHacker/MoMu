it is an ionic tri-iodinated benzoate used as a contrast agent in diagnostic imaging. Like other organic iodine compounds, iothalamic acid blocks x-ray and appears opaque on x-ray film, thereby enhancing the visibility of structure and organs during angiography, arteriography, arthrography, cholangiography, and computed tomography (CT) scanning procedures.
