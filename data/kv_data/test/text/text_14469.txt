it, also known as Î-dodecalactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. Thus, it is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as citrus, cereals and cereal products, milk and milk products, and green vegetables. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
