2, 5-Diethylpyrazine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. 2, 5-Diethylpyrazine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 5-diethylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 5-diethylpyrazine can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 2, 5-diethylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
