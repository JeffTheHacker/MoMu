it is a diastereoisomeric mixture comprising racemic cis- and racemic trans-goglioside A in a 10:1 ratio. It is a potent and rapidly reversible GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) inhibitor. The (3aS,4R,9bR) isomer is the most active (see Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2012, 22, 5177-5181). It has a role as a cis-Golgi ArfGEF GBF inhibitor. It contains a cis-it and a trans-it.
