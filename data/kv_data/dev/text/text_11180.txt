Emetine Hydrochloride is the chloride salt of a white crystalline bitter alkaloid isolated from the root of the plant Psychotria Ipecacuanha (ipecac root) and other plants with antiemetic and anthelminthic properties. Emetine inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic (but not prokaryotic) cells by irreversibly blocking ribosome movement along the mRNA strand and inhibits DNA replication in the early S phase of the cell cycle.
