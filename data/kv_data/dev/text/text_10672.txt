it, also known as fema 2721 or methyl isobutylacetate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid methyl esters. Fatty acid methyl esters are compounds containing a fatty acid that is esterified with a methyl group. They have the general structure RC(=O)OR', where R=fatty aliphatic tail or organyl group and R'=methyl group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, methyl 4-methylpentanoate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, methyl 4-methylpentanoate can be found in fruits. This makes methyl 4-methylpentanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
