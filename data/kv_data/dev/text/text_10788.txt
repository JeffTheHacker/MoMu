it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors. PI3Ka/mTOR Inhibitor it is a second generation, small-molecule mimetic of ATP that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits mTOR and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) alpha. By inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, this agent may inhibit tumor cell proliferation and survival.
