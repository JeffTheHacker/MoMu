Bis(2-furanylmethyl) sulfide, also known as 2, 2'-(thiodimethylene) difuran or bis-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. Bis(2-furanylmethyl) sulfide exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, bis(2-furanylmethyl) sulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Bis(2-furanylmethyl) sulfide is a coffee, earthy, and meaty tasting compound that can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes bis(2-furanylmethyl) sulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
