It is a conjugate acid of a phenoxymethylpenicillin(1-). it is a member of the penicillin family exhibiting broad-spectrum antibiotic property. it binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBP), the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall. This leads to the interruption of cell wall synthesis, consequently leading to bacterial cell growth inhibition and cell lysis.
