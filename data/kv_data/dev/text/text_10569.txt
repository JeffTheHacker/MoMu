it is an odorless white crystalline powder. Slightly bitter taste. Aqueous solutions turn brownish-pink upon prolonged exposure to air. (NTP, 1992) it is the hydrochloride salt form of isoproterenol, a synthetic catechol compound and potent beta adrenergic agonist with peripheral vasodilator, bronchodilator, and cardiac stimulating properties. Isoproterenol exerts its effect on the beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, thereby increasing heart rate and cardiac output. In addition, isoproterenol acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle, thereby causing smooth muscle relaxation.
