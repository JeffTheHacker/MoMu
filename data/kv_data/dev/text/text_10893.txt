Daidzein 7-(6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucoside) is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is daidzein in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a 6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a plant metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an O-acyl carbohydrate, an acetate ester, a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a hydroxyisoflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a member of phenols. It derives from a daidzein.
