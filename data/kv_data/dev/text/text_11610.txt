3beta-Cycloartane-3, 25-diol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cycloartanols and derivatives. These are steroids containing a cycloartanol moiety. 3beta-Cycloartane-3, 25-diol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 3beta-Cycloartane-3, 25-diol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3beta-cycloartane-3, 25-diol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3beta-cycloartane-3, 25-diol can be found in cereals and cereal products and wheat. This makes 3beta-cycloartane-3, 25-diol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
