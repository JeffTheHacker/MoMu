it is a member of the class of piperazines that is piperazine substituted by a furan-2-ylcarbonyl group and a 4-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazolin-2-yl group at positions 1 and 4 respectively. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is a member of piperazines, a member of quinazolines, a member of furans, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an aromatic ether. it is a synthetic piperazine derivative and an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor inhibitor used primarily as an anti-hypertensive. it's effects are most pronounced in the large resistance vessels (i.e. arterioles) and result in a decrease in total systemic vascular resistance (SVR) without a rebound or reflex tachycardia. To a lesser extent, this agent also decreases the tone of the bladder sphincter, thereby allowing the opening of the bladder into the urethra and thus relieving the urinary conditions associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy.
