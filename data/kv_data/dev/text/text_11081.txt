it is a quinoline derivative used for the prevention and therapy of P. falciparum malaria. it therapy is associated with a low rate of transient and asymptomatic serum enzyme elevations and is a rare cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is a quinolinemethanol derivative with antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, and potential chemosensitization and radiosensitization activities. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, it, a weak base, preferentially accumulates in lysosomes and disrupts lysosomal function and integrity, thereby leading to host cell death. Similar to chloroquine, the chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing activities of this agent may be related to its inhibition of autophagocytosis, a cellular mechanism involving lysosomal degradation that minimizes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to tumor reoxygenation and tumor exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Compared to chloroquine, it has better blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration.
