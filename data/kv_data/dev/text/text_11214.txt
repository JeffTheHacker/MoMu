it is the hydrochloride salt form of oxyphencyclimine, a synthetic tertiary amine and antimuscarinic agent with antispasmodic and antisecretory activities. Oxyphencyclimine binds to and blocks the muscarinic receptor on smooth muscle. This agent has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle and therefore prevents spasms in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility, decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretion.
