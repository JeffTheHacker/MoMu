it is a carboxylic ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of indometacin with the hydroxy group of 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]propyl N(2)-benzoyl-N,N-dipropyl-alpha-glutaminate. Used (as its dimaleate salt) to control pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders. Following oral administration, it is metabolised to indometacin and proglumide, a drug with antisecretory effects that helps prevent injury to the stomach lining. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an antipyretic and a prodrug. It is a N-acylindole, an aromatic ether, a carboxylic ester, a N-alkylpiperazine, a member of benzamides and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It derives from an indometacin and a proglumide.
