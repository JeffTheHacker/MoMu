Alantolactone, also known as helenin or alant camphor, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmanolides, secoeudesmanolides, and derivatives. These are terpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmanolide (a 3, 5a, 9-trimethyl-naphtho[1, 2-b]furan-2-one derivative) or secoeudesmanolide (a 3, 6-dimethyl-5-(pentan-2-yl)-1-benzofuran-2-one derivative) skeleton. Alantolactone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, alantolactone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, alantolactone can be found in herbs and spices. This makes alantolactone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
