it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 5-disubstituted oxazoles. 2, 5-disubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-methyl-2-propyloxazole is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 5-methyl-2-propyloxazole can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 5-methyl-2-propyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
