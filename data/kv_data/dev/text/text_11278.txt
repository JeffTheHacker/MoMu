it, also known as 6-deoxyphysalin h, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as physalins and derivatives. These are steroidal constituents of Physalis plants which possess an unusual 13, 14-seco-16, 24-cyclo-steroidal ring skeleton (where the bond that is normally present between the 13 and 14 positions in other steroids is broken while a new bond between positions 16 and 24 is formed). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, physalin H is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, physalin H can be found in fruits and herbs and spices. This makes physalin H a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
