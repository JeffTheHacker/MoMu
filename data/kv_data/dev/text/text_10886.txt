5, 14-Dihydroxy-11-methoxy-6, 8, 19-trioxapentacyclo[10. 7. 0. 0Â², â¹. 0Â³, â·. 0Â¹Â³, Â¹â·]nonadeca-1(12), 2(9), 10, 13(17)-tetraene-16, 18-dione, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as difurocoumarocyclopentenones. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a cyclopenten-2-one ring fused to the coumarin moiety of the difurocoumarin skeleton. 5, 14-Dihydroxy-11-methoxy-6, 8, 19-trioxapentacyclo[10. 7. 0. 0Â², â¹. 0Â³, â·. 0Â¹Â³, Â¹â·]nonadeca-1(12), 2(9), 10, 13(17)-tetraene-16, 18-dione is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa).
