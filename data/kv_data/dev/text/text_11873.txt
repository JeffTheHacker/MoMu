it is the L-enantiomer of it. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor, a protective agent, a nutraceutical, a micronutrient, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a non-essential amino acid. In hepatocytes, it is synthesized in the urea cycle by the addition of carbon dioxide and ammonia to ornithine. it is converted into L-arginine by the enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase in the presence of L-aspartate and ATP. Subsequently, L-arginine is converted to nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase and it is regenerated as a by-product.
