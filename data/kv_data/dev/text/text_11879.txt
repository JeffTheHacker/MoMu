it, also known as sativin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 4'-o-methylated isoflavonoids. These are isoflavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C4' atom of the isoflavonoid backbone. Isoflavonoids are natural products derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in pulses. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
