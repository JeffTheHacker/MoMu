Cocarboxylase, also known as berolase, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thiamine phosphates. These are thiamine derivatives in which the hydroxyl group of the ethanol moiety is substituted by a phosphate group. Within the cell, cocarboxylase is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Cocarboxylase exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
