Xi-it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. Xi-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in fruits and herbs and spices. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
