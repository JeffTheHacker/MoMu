it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles used widely in the treatment of hypertension. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of biphenyls, a member of benzimidazoles and a carboxybiphenyl. it is a benzimidazole derivative and a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive property. it selectively antagonizes angiotensin II binding to the AT1 subtype receptor, located in vascular smooth muscle and adrenal gland. The antagonism results in vasodilation and inhibits the angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone production, which in turn leading to a decrease in sodium and water as well as an increase in potassium excretion leading to a subsequent reduction in blood pressure.
