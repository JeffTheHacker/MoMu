it, also known as bryonolate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclic alcohols and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing an aliphatic ring substituted with at least one hydroxyl group. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, bryonolic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, bryonolic acid can be found in a number of food items such as olive, calabash, watermelon, and fruits. This makes bryonolic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
