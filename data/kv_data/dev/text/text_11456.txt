it is a lignan that is tetrahydrofuran substituted by methyl groups at positions 3 and 4, a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group at position 5 and a 1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl moiety at position 2 (the 2S,3R,4R,5R stereoisomer). Isolated from the aerial parts of Piper futokadsura, it exhibits inhibitory activity against production of nitric oxide (NO). It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a lignan, a dimethoxybenzene, a member of benzodioxoles and a member of oxolanes.
