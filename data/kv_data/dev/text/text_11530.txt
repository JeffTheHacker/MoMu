it (anhydrous) is the monohydrochloride salt of levobupivacaine. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an adrenergic antagonist, an amphiphile, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and an EC 3.6.3.8 (Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor. It contains a levobupivacaine(1+). It is an enantiomer of a dextrobupivacaine hydrochloride (anhydrous). Levobupivacaine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt of levobupivacaine, an amide derivative with anesthetic property. Levobupivacaine reversibly binds voltage-gated sodium channels to modulate ionic flux and prevent the initiation and transmission of nerve impulses (stabilizing neuronal membrane), thereby resulting in analgesia and anesthesia. In comparison with racemic bupivacaine, levobupivacaine is associated with less vasodilation and has a longer duration of action.
