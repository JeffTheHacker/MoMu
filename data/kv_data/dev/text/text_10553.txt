Mercury((o-carboxyphenyl)thio)ethyl, sodium salt is a light cream-colored crystalline powder with a slight odor: pH (1% aqueous solution) 6.7. Slight odor. (NTP, 1992) it is an alkylmercury compound (approximately 49% mercury by weight) used as an antiseptic and antifungal agent. It has a role as a disinfectant, an antifungal drug, an antiseptic drug and a drug allergen. It contains an ethylmercurithiosalicylate. it is an organomercurial compound and derivative of thiosalicyclic acid with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it inhibits sulfhydryl-containing active site of various enzymes and binds to sulfhydryl compounds, such as glutathione, cysteine, and SH groups of proteins. In addition, it activates the InsP3 calcium channel on endoplasmic reticular membrane, thereby triggering the release of calcium from intracellular stores resulting in a calcium-induced calcium-influx of extracellular calcium. Consequently, it may induce or inhibit cellular functions dependent on calcium signaling.
