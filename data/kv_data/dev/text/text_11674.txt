Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Use of ziprasidone has not been consistently associated with serum enzyme elevations and has yet to be linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is the hydrochloride salt form of ziprasidone, a benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property. it functions as an antagonist at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor. it also inhibits synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. The mechanism of action by which ziprasidone hydrochloride exerts its antischizophrenic effect is unknown but is potentially mediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 antagonism. This agent also has antagonistic activity against histamine H1 and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.
