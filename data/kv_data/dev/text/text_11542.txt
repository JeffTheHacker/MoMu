it is a cyclic beta-diketone consisting of indane-1,3-dione having a 4-methoxyphenyl substituent at the 4-position. It has a role as an anticoagulant and a vitamin K antagonist. It is a beta-diketone and an aromatic ketone. It derives from a hydride of an indane. it is a synthetic indanedione anticoagulant. it interferes with the vitamin K-dependent hepatic synthesis of active clotting factors by inhibiting the reduction of vitamin K. This leads to an inhibition of gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. The consequential effects of this inhibition include a reduced activity of these clotting factors and prolonged blood clotting time.
