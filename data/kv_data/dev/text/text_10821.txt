it is a cephalosporin with ({1-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-tetrazol-5-yl}sulfanyl)methyl and (2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)acetamido substituents at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the cephem skeleton. A third generation beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic, it is active against a broad spectrum of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a cephalosporin, a semisynthetic derivative and a beta-lactam antibiotic allergen. it is a third-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
