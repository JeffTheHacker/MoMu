it is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of 3-methylflavone-8-carboxylic acid with 2-(1-piperidinyl)ethanol. It has a role as a parasympatholytic, a muscarinic antagonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is a member of piperidines, a member of flavones, a carboxylic ester and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a 3-methylflavone-8-carboxylic acid and a 2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethanol. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a synthetic parasympatholytic with antimuscarinic, muscle relaxant and urinary antispasmodic properties. it binds and inhibits muscarinic receptors, thereby suppressing the micturition reflex and increases urinary bladder capacity by modifying the micturition center in the brain stem. In addition, this agent has been found to inhibit cyclic AMP formation in striatal membranes of the brain through stimulation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors which in turn suppress isovolumetric urinary bladder contraction.
