Creamy white crystals or off-white powder. Used as an anti-cancer medicine. it is an alkylating derivative of the pyrimidine nucleobase uracil that is bound to nitrogen mustard, with antineoplastic activity. it alkylates and damages DNA by binding to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA. This leads to cross-linking of DNA, which inhibits DNA synthesis and promotes cell death in rapidly metabolizing cells, such as cancer cells.
