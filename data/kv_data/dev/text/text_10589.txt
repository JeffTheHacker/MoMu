it is a pyranoindolizinoquinoline that is pyrano[3',4':6,7]indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline which is substituted by oxo groups at positions 3 and 14, and by an ethyl group and a hydroxy group at position 4 (the S enantiomer). It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, a genotoxin and a plant metabolite. It is a pyranoindolizinoquinoline, a tertiary alcohol, a delta-lactone and a quinoline alkaloid. it is an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata, with antineoplastic activity. During the S phase of the cell cycle, it selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, thereby inhibiting religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks and producing potentially lethal double-strand DNA breaks when encountered by the DNA replication machinery.
