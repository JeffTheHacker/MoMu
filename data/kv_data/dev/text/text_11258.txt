2', 6'-Dihydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone, also known as it or 1-(2, 6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)ethanone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. 2', 6'-Dihydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2', 6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2', 6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone can be found in european plum, fruits, and sweet orange. This makes 2', 6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
