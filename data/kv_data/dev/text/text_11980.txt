Iodochlorohydroxyquinoline is a cream-colored to brownish-yellow powder. Practically odorless. Decomposes at 178-179Â°C. Used as a topical anti-infective. it is a monohydroxyquinoline that is quinolin-8-ol in which the hydrogens at positions 5 and 7 are replaced by chlorine and iodine, respectively. It has antibacterial and atifungal properties, and is used in creams for the treatment of skin infections. It has also been investigated as a chelator of copper and zinc ions for the possible treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It has a role as an antifungal agent, an antineoplastic agent, an antimicrobial agent, an antibacterial agent, a chelator and an antiprotozoal drug. It is an organochlorine compound, an organoiodine compound and a monohydroxyquinoline. it is an orally bioavailable, lipophilic, copper-binding, halogenated 8-hydroxyquinoline with antifungal, antiparasitic and potential antitumor activities. it forms a stable chelate with copper (copper (II) ions), which inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome; consequently, ubiquitinated proteins may accumulate in tumor cells, followed by tumor cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In addition, the it-copper complex appears to decrease the expression of androgen receptors (AR) in human copper-enriched prostate cancer cells. Serum levels of copper are often elevated in patients with cancer; copper chelation may inhibit copper-dependent endothelial cell proliferation and tumor secretion of angiogenic factors.
