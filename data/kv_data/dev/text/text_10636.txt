it, also known as S-methylmethane thiosulfinic acid or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thiosulfinic acid esters. These are organic compounds containing an ester of thiosulfinic acid with the general structure RS(=S)OR' (R, R'=alkyl, aryl). it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, S-methyl methanesulfinothioate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, S-methyl methanesulfinothioate can be found in soft-necked garlic. This makes S-methyl methanesulfinothioate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
