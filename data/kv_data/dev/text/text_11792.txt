it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a sweetish solvent odor. Difficult to ignite. Used as a laboratory reagent and in the production of some organic chemicals. it is an acetate ester obtained by the formal condensation of phenol with acetic acid. It is a member of its and a member of benzenes. It derives from a phenol. it is an aromatic fatty acid metabolite of phenylalanine with potential antineoplastic activity. Naturally occurring in mammals, phenylacetate induces differentiation, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in tumor cells. Implicated mechanisms of action include decreased protein prenylation, activation of the peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors, inhibition of DNA methylation, and depletion of glutamine.
