it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzothiazoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene fused to a thiazole ring (a five-membered ring with four carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom and one sulfur atom). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-butylbenzothiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2-butylbenzothiazole can be found in nuts. This makes 2-butylbenzothiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
