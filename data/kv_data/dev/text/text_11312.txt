it is a hydrochloride resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of bromhexine and hydrogen chloride. It is used as a mucolytic for the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with productive cough (i.e. a cough characterised by the production of sputum). It has a role as a mucolytic. It contains a bromhexine(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of bromhexine, a secretolytic, with mucolytic activity. Upon administration, bromhexine increases lysosomal activity and enhances hydrolysis of acid mucopolysaccharide polymers in the respiratory tract. This increases the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, which makes the phlegm thinner and decreases mucus viscosity. This contributes to its secretomotoric effect, and allows the cilia to more easily transport the phlegm out of the lungs. This clears mucus from the respiratory tract and may aid in the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with abnormal viscid mucus, excessive mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport.
