it is a haloalkane that is perfluorooctane in which a fluorine attached to one of the terminal carbons has been replaced by a bromine. It has a role as a radioopaque medium and a blood substitute. It is a perfluorinated compound, an organobromine compound and a haloalkane. It derives from a hydride of an octane. it is a synthetic radiopaque liquid form of it. Used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is also used as a liquid ventilation agent to improve pulmonary gas exchange and lung compliance and may be used in surgery to reduce or eliminate the need for donor blood. Ventilation with perfluorocarbon fluid improves lung function in conditions involving surfactant deficiency and dysfunction, including respiratory distress syndrome and adult respiratory distress syndrome.
