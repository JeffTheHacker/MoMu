Ceftaroline Fosamil is an N-phosphono prodrug of the fifth-generation cephalosporin derivative ceftaroline with antibacterial activity. Ceftaroline fosamil is hydrolyzed to the active form ceftaroline in vivo. Ceftaroline binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. it is the acetic acid salt form of ceftaroline fosamil, an N-phosphono type prodrug of the fifth-generation cephalosporin derivative ceftaroline with antibacterial activity. Ceftaroline fosamil, when hydrolyzed to the active form ceftaroline, has a high affinity for penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which is associated with methicillin resistance. As a result, ceftaroline is unique in its activity against methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-intermediate, linezolid-resistant, and daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains.
