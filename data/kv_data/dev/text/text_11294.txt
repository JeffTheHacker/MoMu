DG(18:0/18:0/0:0)[rac], also known as 1, 2-dioctadecanoylglycerol or 1, 2-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 2-diacylglycerols. These are diacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at positions 1 and 2. Thus, DG(18:0/18:0/0:0)[rac] is considered to be a diradylglycerol lipid molecule. DG(18:0/18:0/0:0)[rac] exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, DG(18:0/18:0/0:0)[rac] is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
