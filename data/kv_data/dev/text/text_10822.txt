Succinyl-CoA, also known as CoA S-succinate or suc-CO-a, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Succinyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Succinyl-CoA has been found in human testicle and muscle tissues, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, succinyl-CoA is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Acetoacetic acid and succinyl-CoA can be converted into succinic acid through the action of the enzyme succinyl-coa:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1, mitochondrial. In humans, succinyl-CoA is involved in the porphyrin metabolism pathway, the threonine and 2-oxobutanoate degradation pathway, the ketone body metabolism pathway, and the oncogenic action OF fumarate pathway. Succinyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include fumarase deficiency, the sarcosinemia pathway, the maple syrup urine disease pathway, and the 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I pathway.
