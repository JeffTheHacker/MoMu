it is an organic heterotetracyclic compound and 19-membered macrocyclic lactam antibiotic originally isolated from the Ethiopian shrub Maytenus serrata but also found in other Maytenus species. It exhibits cytotoxicity against many tumour cell lines. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antimicrobial agent, an antineoplastic agent, a tubulin modulator and an antimitotic. It is an epoxide, a carbamate ester, an organochlorine compound, an alpha-amino acid ester, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a maytansinoid. it is an ansamycin antibiotic originally isolated from the Ethiopian shrub Maytenus serrata. it binds to tubulin at the rhizoxin binding site, thereby inhibiting microtubule assembly, inducing microtubule disassembly, and disrupting mitosis. it exhibits cytotoxicity against many tumor cell lines and may inhibit tumor growth in vivo. (NCI04)
