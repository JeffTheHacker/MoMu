it is a steroid ester resulting from the formal condensation of the 17-hydroxy function of fluorometholone with acetic acid. Used in the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the eye. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a steroid ester, a glucocorticoid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, an acetate ester and a fluorinated steroid. It derives from a Delta(1)-progesterone and a fluorometholone. it is the acetate salt form of fluorometholone, a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties. it exerts its effect by interacting with cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. The synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins is induced while the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators is inhibited. As a result, there is an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions.
