it is a member of the class of imidazoles that is 1H-imidazole in which the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen is replaced by a monochlorotrityl group. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of imidazoles, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a conazole antifungal drug and an imidazole antifungal drug. it is a synthetic, imidazole derivate with broad-spectrum, antifungal activity. it inhibits biosynthesis of sterols, particularly ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, thereby damaging and affecting the permeability of the cell membrane. This results in leakage and loss of essential intracellular compounds, and eventually causes cell lysis.
