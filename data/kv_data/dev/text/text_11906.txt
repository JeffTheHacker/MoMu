it is a C-glycosyl compound that is 1,3-thiazole-4-carboxamide in which the hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by a beta-D-ribofuranosyl group. It is metabolised to thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), a selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMP dehydrogenase). It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP dehydrogenase) inhibitor, a prodrug and an antineoplastic agent. It is a C-glycosyl compound, a member of 1,3-thiazoles and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a beta-D-ribose. it is a synthetic nucleoside analogue with antineoplastic activity. it (TR) is anabolized intracellularly to an analogue of NAD, tiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), a potent inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH); IMPDH is the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo purine synthesis. Inhibition of IMPDH results in reduced levels of guanylates, resulting in the inhibition tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. (NCI04)
