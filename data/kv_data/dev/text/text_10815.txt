it is a clear slightly yellow liquid. Boiling point 175-177Â°C. Can reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen. Used as a gasoline and lubricant additive and as an antioxidant and stabilizer in plastics. it is a nitrosamine that is N-ethylethanamine substituted by a nitroso group at the N-atom. It has a role as a mutagen, a hepatotoxic agent and a carcinogenic agent. it is a synthetic light-sensitive, volatile, clear yellow oil that is soluble in water, lipids, and other organic solvents. It is used as gasoline and lubricant additive, antioxidant, and stabilizer for industry materials. When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. it affects DNA integrity, probably by alkylation, and is used in experimental research to induce liver tumorigenesis. It is considered to be reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
