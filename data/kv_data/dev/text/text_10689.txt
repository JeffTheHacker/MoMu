Levetiracetam, also known as keppra or ucb L060, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof. Levetiracetam is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Levetiracetam has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, levetiracetam is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Levetiracetam is a potentially toxic compound.
