Parillin, also known as sarsasaponin or smilacin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. Parillin exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Parillin has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, parillin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, parillin can be found in herbs and spices. This makes parillin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
