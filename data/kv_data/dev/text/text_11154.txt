it is a 4-demethoxydaunorubicin (idarubicin) analog with an aziridinyl group in position C-3' and a methylsulphonyl on position C-4', with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, it alkylates guanine residues at the N7 position in the DNA major groove, resulting in DNA base pair mismatching, DNA interstrand crosslinking, the inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis.
