it is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with [(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)sulfanyl]methyl and (R)-2-{[(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-yl)carbonyl]amino}-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido groups at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the cephem skeleton. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a cephalosporin and a carboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a third-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
