it is an odorless white crystalline powder with a feebly acid taste. pH (saturated aqueous solution) 2.7. pH (1.3% solution) 3-3.5. (NTP, 1992) it is a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid that is pyridine in which the hydrogen at position 3 is replaced by a carboxy group. It has a role as an antidote, an antilipemic drug, a vasodilator agent, a metabolite, a B vitamin, an EC 3.5.1.19 (nicotinamidase) inhibitor, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid and a pyridine alkaloid. It is a conjugate acid of a nicotinate. it is a water-soluble vitamin belonging to the vitamin B family, which occurs in many animal and plant tissues, with antihyperlipidemic activity. it is converted to its active form itamide, which is a component of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphate form, NADP. These coenzymes play an important role in tissue respiration and in glycogen, lipid, amino acid, protein, and purine metabolism. Although the exact mechanism of action by which it lowers cholesterol is not fully understood, it may act by inhibiting the synthesis of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), inhibiting the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, increasing lipoprotein lipase activity, and reducing the hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and LDL-C.
