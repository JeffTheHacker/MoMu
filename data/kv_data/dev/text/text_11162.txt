it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Leiomyoma and Clinical Trial, Phase I. it is an orally available progestin and selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), with potential anti-progesterone and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, it competitively binds to the progesterone receptor (PR) in progesterone-responsive tissue and inhibits PR-mediated gene expression. This interferes with progesterone activity in the reproductive system and may inhibit PR-mediated proliferative effects in cells overexpressing PRs. As a result, this agent may suppress ovulation and inhibit proliferation of endometrial tissue or uterine fibroid formation.
