it is the mixed (methyl, ethyl) diester of 4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid. A calcium-channel blocker, it lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance through a highly selective action on smooth muscle in arteriolar resistance vessels. It is used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. It has a role as a calcium channel blocker, an antihypertensive agent, a vasodilator agent and an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a dihydropyridine, a dichlorobenzene, an ethyl ester and a methyl ester. it is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent. it inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, causing dilatation of the main coronary and systemic arteries and decreasing myocardial contractility. This agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein which is overexpressed in some multi-drug resistant tumors and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents. (NCI04)
