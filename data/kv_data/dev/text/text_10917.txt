it is a lipopeptide that is an analogue of human GLP-1 in which the lysine residue at position 27 is replaced by arginine and a hexadecanoyl group attached to the remaining lysine via a glutamic acid spacer. Used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has a role as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and a neuroprotective agent. It is a lipopeptide and a polypeptide. it is a long-acting, fatty acylated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog administered subcutaneously, with antihyperglycemic activity. it's prolonged action and half-life of 11-15 hours are attributed to the attachment of the fatty acid palmitic acid to GLP-1 that reversibly binds to albumin. Albumin binding protects liraglutide from immediate degradation and elimination and causes GLP-1 to be released from abumin in a slow and consistent manner. This agent may cause thyroid C-cell tumors and increases the risk of acute pancreatitis.
