4-(2, 6, 6-Trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)-2-butanol, also known as 7, 8-dihydro-b-ionol or a, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-1-cyclohexene-1-propanol, 9CI, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. 4-(2, 6, 6-Trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)-2-butanol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-(2, 6, 6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)-2-butanol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 4-(2, 6, 6-Trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)-2-butanol is an amber, floral, and woody tasting compound that can be found in fruits and tea. This makes 4-(2, 6, 6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)-2-butanol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
