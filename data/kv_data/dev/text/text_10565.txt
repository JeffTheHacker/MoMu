it appears as white or cream to slightly yellow crystals or crystalline powder. Odorless with a bitter taste. (NTP, 1992) it is an alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a first generation antipsychotic, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a plant metabolite. It is an alkaloid ester, a methyl ester and a yohimban alkaloid. It derives from a reserpic acid. it is an alkaloid, derived from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentine and vomitoria, and an adrenergic uptake inhibitor with antihypertensive effects. it is lipid soluble and can penetrate blood-brain barrier. This agent binds and inhibits catecholamine pump on the storage vesicles in central and peripheral adrenergic neurons, thereby inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine, dopamine serotonin into presynaptic storage vesicles. This results in catecholamines and serotonin lingering in the cytoplasm where they are destroyed by intraneuronal monoamine oxidase, thereby causing the depletion of catecholamine and serotonin stores in central and peripheral nerve terminals. Depletion results in a lack of active transmitter discharge from nerve endings upon nerve depolarization, and consequently leads to a decreased heart rate and decreased arterial blood pressure as well as sedative effects.
