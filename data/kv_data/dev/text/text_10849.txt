it is an aromatic ether that is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene which is substituted at position 2 by a 2-(glycylamino)-1-hydroxyethyl group. A direct-acting sympathomimetic with selective alpha-adrenergic agonist activity, it is used (generally as its hydrochloride salt) as a peripheral vasoconstrictor in the treatment of certain hypotensive states. The main active moiety is its major metabolite, deglyit. It has a role as a prodrug, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent and a vasoconstrictor agent. It is a secondary alcohol, an amino acid amide and an aromatic ether. It derives from a glycinamide and a deglyit. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a direct-acting prodrug and sympathomimetic agent with antihypotensive properties. it is converted to its active metabolite, desglyit by deglycination reaction. Desglyit selectively binds to and activates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature. This causes smooth muscle contraction and leads to an elevation of blood pressure. Desglyit diffuses poorly across the blood-brain barrier, and is therefore not associated with effects on the central nervous system (CNS).
