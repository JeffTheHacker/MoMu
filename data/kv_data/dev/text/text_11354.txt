Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane is the beta-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane. It has a role as a pesticide and a persistent organic pollutant. it is the gamma-isomer of benzene hexachloride, a colorless to white colored, synthetic, crystalline solid with a slight musty odor that emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition. it is used as an insecticide for hardwood logs, lumber, and crops. it also has topical pediculicide and scabicide activities probably due to its neurotoxic effects. Inhalation exposure to this substance causes severe irritation of the nose and throat, causes anemia, and affects the liver, nervous, cardiovascular, and immune system. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
