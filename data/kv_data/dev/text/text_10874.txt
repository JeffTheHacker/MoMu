Pristanoyl-CoA, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain 3-oxoacyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A derivative, which is 3-oxo acylated long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms. Pristanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Pristanoyl-CoA has been found in human liver tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, pristanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm and peroxisome. In humans, pristanoyl-CoA is involved in the oxidation OF branched chain fatty acids pathway.
