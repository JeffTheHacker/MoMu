it is a metal sulfate in which the metal is beryllium (in the +2 oxidation state) and the ratio of beryllium to sulfate is 1:1. It has a role as an allergen. It contains a beryllium(2+). it is a white colored, crystalline, inorganic compound that emits toxic fumes of beryllium oxides and sulfur oxides upon heating. it is mainly used to produce beryllium oxide for high-technology ceramics. Inhalation exposure to its dust and fumes irritates the nose, throat and lungs and can cause pneumonitis. Prolonged exposure can result in a chronic beryllium disease called berylliosis causing granuloma and fibrosis formation in the lungs. Beryllium is associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. (NCI05)
