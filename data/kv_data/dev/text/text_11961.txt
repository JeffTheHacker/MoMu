2, 3, 4, 6-Tetrachloroanisole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anisoles. These are organic compounds containing a methoxybenzene or a derivative thereof. 2, 3, 4, 6-Tetrachloroanisole exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 3, 4, 6-tetrachloroanisole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 3, 4, 6-Tetrachloroanisole exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
