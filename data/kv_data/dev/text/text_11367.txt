it is a tricyclic antidepressant that widely used in the therapy of depression. it can cause mild and transient serum enzyme elevations but is a rare cause of clinically apparent acute cholestatic liver injury. it is a dibenzoxepin derivative and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with antipruritic, antidepressive and anxiolytic activities. it blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) into presynaptic terminals thereby prolonging the availability of the monoaminergic neurotransmitters within the synaptic cleft and enhancing their neurotransmission. it also has antagonistic effects on histamine H1, 5-HT2, alpha-1 adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. The antipruritic effect of this agent is mediated through inhibition of histamine receptors.
