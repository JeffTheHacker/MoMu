it is the edisylate salt form of prochlorperazine, a derivative of phenothiazine with antipsychotic and antiemetic properties. it blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors in cortical and limbic areas of the brain, thereby preventing the excess of dopamine in the brain. This leads to a reduction in psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions. it appears to exert its antiemetic activity by blocking the dopamine and histamine receptors in the chemical trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, thereby relieving nausea and vomiting.
