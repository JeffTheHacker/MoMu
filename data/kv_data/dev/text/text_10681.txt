it is a pyrimidinone derivative with anti-allergic activity. it blocks the antigen-mediated calcium ion influx into mast cells. This prevents mast cell degranulation, resulting in mast cell stabilization and inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, which are involved in the allergic process. it also prevents inflammatory mediator release from eosinophils.
