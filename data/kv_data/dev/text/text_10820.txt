it is the hydrochloride salt form of nalbuphine, a synthetic phenanthrene opioid with opiate agonist and antagonist effects, used to treat moderate to severe pain and provide preoperative and postoperative analgesia and sedation. it binds to kappa-, mu- and delta-opioid receptors but not to sigma-opioid receptors. This opioid exerts its analgesic actions primarily through kappa-opioid-receptor agonism and partially through mu-opioid receptor agonism.
