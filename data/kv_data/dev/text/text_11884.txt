Aflatoxin b2 belongs to the class of organic compounds known as difurocoumarocyclopentenones. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a cyclopenten-2-one ring fused to the coumarin moiety of the difurocoumarin skeleton. Aflatoxin b2 exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, aflatoxin B2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Aflatoxin b2 is formally rated as a carcinogen (by IARC 1) and is also a potentially toxic compound.
