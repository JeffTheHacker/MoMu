it is the hydrobromide salt of fenoterol. A beta2-adrenergic agonist, it is used as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airway obstruction. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a beta-adrenergic agonist and a sympathomimetic agent. It contains a fenoterol. itThe hydrobromide salt of fenoterol, a short-acting sympathomimetic agent with bronchodilator activity. Fenoterol stimulates beta-2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, thereby activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP concentrations relax bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, and reduce inflammatory cell mediator release, especially from mast cells.
