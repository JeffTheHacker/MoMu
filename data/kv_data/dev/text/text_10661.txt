An iron-binding protein that was originally characterized as a milk protein. It is widely distributed in secretory fluids and is found in the neutrophilic granules of LEUKOCYTES. The N-terminal part of it possesses a serine protease which functions to inactivate the type III secretion system used by bacteria to export virulence proteins for host cell invasion.
