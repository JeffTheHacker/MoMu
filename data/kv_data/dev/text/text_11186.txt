TG(20:0/20:0/20:0), also known as tag(60:0) or tracylglycerol(60:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triacylglycerols. These are glycerides consisting of three fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Thus, TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) is considered to be a triradylglycerol lipid molecule. TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) has been found in human adipose tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and adiposome. TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) can be biosynthesized from DG(20:0/20:0/0:0) and eicosanoyl-CoA; which is catalyzed by the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase. In humans, TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) is involved in the metabolic disorder called de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(20:0/20:0/20:0) pathway.
