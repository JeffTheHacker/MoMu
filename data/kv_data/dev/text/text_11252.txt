it is a C19-gibberellin, initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi. It differs from gibberellin A1 in the absence of the beta-OH at C-9 and the alpha-OH at C-7, the substitution of the methylene group at C-8 by a beta-Me and the presence of an alpha-OH also at C-8 (all gibbane skeletal numberings). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a C19-gibberellin, a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid and a lactone.
