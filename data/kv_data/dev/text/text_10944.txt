it, also known as fema 3741, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as monocyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing 1 ring in the isoprene chain. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, campholenic alcohol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, campholenic alcohol can be found in fruits. This makes campholenic alcohol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
