it is a tryptamine derivative that consists of serotonin bearing an additional O-nonyl substituent. 5-HT1B selective agonist, several times more potent than sumatriptan and inactive as a 5-HT1A agonist (Ki at 5-HT1B = 1 nM, selectivity over 5-HT1A > 300-fold). It has a role as a serotonergic agonist. It is a member of tryptamines, a primary amino compound and an aromatic ether. It derives from a serotonin. It is a conjugate base of a 5-nonyloxytryptaminium(1+).
