it is an organic sodium salt that is the heptahydrate form of pemetrexed disodium. Inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), 421 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). It has a role as an antimetabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor, an EC 2.1.1.45 (thymidylate synthase) inhibitor and an EC 2.1.2.2 (phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase) inhibitor. It is an organic sodium salt and a hydrate. It contains a pemetrexed disodium. Pemetrexed Disodium is the disodium salt of a synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) which catalyses the methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.
