it, also known as aminomebendazole or ambz CPD, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzophenones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone attached to two phenyl groups. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 2-amino-5-benzoylbenzimidazole is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
