Hydroxyglutamic acid, also known as Hydroxyglutamic acid, erythro-(DL)-isomer or beta-Hydroxyglutamate, is classified as a glutamic acid or a derivative. A glutamic acid or a derivative are compounds containing glutamic acid or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of glutamic acid at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom.
