4, 5-Dimethoxy-1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, also known as 4, 5-dimethoxy-phthalic acid or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as p-methoxybenzoic acids and derivatives. These are benzoic acids in which the hydrogen atom at position 4 of the benzene ring is replaced by a methoxy group. 4, 5-Dimethoxy-1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4, 5-dimethoxy-1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
