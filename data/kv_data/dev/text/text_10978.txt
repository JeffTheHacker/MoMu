5-Ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. 5-Ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 5-Ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, 5-ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole can be found in coffee and coffee products and potato. This makes 5-ethyl-2, 4-dimethyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
