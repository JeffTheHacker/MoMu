it is a pyranoindolizinoquinoline used as an antineoplastic agent. It is a derivative of camptothecin and works by binding to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and preventing religation of these 328 single strand breaks. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. it is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, a cytotoxic, quinoline-based alkaloid extracted from the Asian tree Camptotheca acuminata. it inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes during S phase of cell cycle, thereby inhibiting religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks and producing potentially lethal double-strand DNA breaks when encountered by the DNA replication machinery.
