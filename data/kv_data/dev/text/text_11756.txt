it is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempherol substituted by a 6-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a 6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone and a dihydroxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
