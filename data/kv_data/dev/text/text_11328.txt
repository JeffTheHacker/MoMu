it is a tetrapeptide consisting of Fmoc-L-aspartic acid 4-methyl ester, methyl L-alpha-glutamic acid 5-methyl ester, L-valine and the fluoromethyl ketone derived from the 1-carboxy group of L-aspartic acid 4-methyl ester coupled in sequence. It is a specific, irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor that also shows potent inhibition of caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-10. It has a role as an apoptosis inhibitor, an EC 3.4.22.56 (caspase-3) inhibitor and a neuroprotective agent.
