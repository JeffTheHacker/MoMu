2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-{[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl](methyl)amino}-2-(propan-2-yl)pentanenitrile is a tertiary amino compound that is 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine in which the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen are replaced by a methyl group and a 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexyl group. It is a tertiary amino compound, an aromatic ether, a polyether and a nitrile. it is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocking agent. it inhibits the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, causing dilatation of the main coronary and systemic arteries and decreasing myocardial contractility. This agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein which is overexpressed in some multi-drug resistant tumors and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents. (NCI04)
