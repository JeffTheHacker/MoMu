it is a member of the class of 1-benzothiophenes that is 1-benzothiophene in which the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a 1-[carbamoyl(hydroxy)amino]ethyl group. A selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, it inhibits the formation of leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LDT4, and LTE4. It is used for the management of chronic asthma. It has a role as an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an anti-asthmatic drug and a leukotriene antagonist. It is a member of ureas and a member of 1-benzothiophenes. It derives from a hydride of a 1-benzothiophene. it is a synthetic derivative of hydroxyurea with antiasthmatic properties. The leukotriene inhibitor it blocks 5-lipoxygenase, which catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid; causes bronchodilation; decreases bronchial mucous secretion and edema; and may prevent or decrease the symptoms of asthma.
