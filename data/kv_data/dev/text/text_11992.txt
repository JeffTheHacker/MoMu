7, 9-Docosanedione belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta-diketones. These are organic compounds containing two keto groups separated by a single carbon atom. 7, 9-Docosanedione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 7, 9-docosanedione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 7, 9-docosanedione can be found in fats and oils. This makes 7, 9-docosanedione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
