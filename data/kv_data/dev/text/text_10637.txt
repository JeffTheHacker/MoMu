it is a pentadentate aromatic metallotexaphyrin with photosensitizing properties. it preferentially accumulates in tumor cells due to their increased rates of metabolism and absorbs light, forming an extended high energy conformational state that produces high quantum yields of singlet oxygen, resulting in local cytotoxic effects.
