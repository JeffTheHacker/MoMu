it is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid and a terminal acetylenic compound. It has a role as a contraceptive drug, a progestin, a synthetic oral contraceptive and a female contraceptive drug. It derives from a norgestrel. It is an enantiomer of a dexonorgestrel. it is the levorotatory form of norgestrel and synthetic progestogen with progestational and androgenic activity. it binds to the progesterone receptor in the nucleus of target cells, thereby stimulating the resulting hormone-receptor complex, initiating transcription, and increasing the synthesis of certain proteins. This results in a suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) activity and an inhibition of ovulation, as well as an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium.
