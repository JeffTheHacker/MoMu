it is a thienothiazine-derived monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-hydroxy-2-methylthieno[2,3-e][1,2]thiazine-3-carboxylic acid 1,1-dioxide with the amino group of 2-aminopyridine. Used for the treatment of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
