it is a withanolide saponin that consists of withaferin A attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 27 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Physalis longifolia, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a withanolide saponin, a delta-lactone, a 4-hydroxy steroid, an enone, an ergostanoid, a secondary alcohol, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and an epoxy steroid.
