it, also known as it or 2-(p-tolyl)-1-propanol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-propanol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-propanol can be found in fruits. This makes 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-propanol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
