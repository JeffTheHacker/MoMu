it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as protoberberine alkaloids and derivatives. These are alkaloids with a structure based on a protoberberine moiety, which consists of a 5, 6-dihydrodibenzene moiety fused to a quinolizinium and forming 5, 6-Dihydrodibenzo(a, g)quinolizinium skeleton. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, lambertine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, lambertine can be found in fruits and tea. This makes lambertine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
