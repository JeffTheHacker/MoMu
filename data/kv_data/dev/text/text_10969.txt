it is an N-arylpiperazine that is piperazine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 1 is replaced by a 6-methoxy-7-[3-(piperidin-1-yl)propoxy]quinazolin-4-yl group, while the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 4 is replaced by a (p-isopropoxyphenyl)aminocarbonyl group. it is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases FLT3, PDGFR and KIT. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is a N-carbamoylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a member of quinazolines, a member of piperidines, an aromatic ether, a tertiary amino compound and a member of phenylureas. it is a piperazinyl quinazoline receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antineoplastic activity. it inhibits the autophosphorylation of FLT3 (FMS-Like Tyrosine kinase-3), c-KIT and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis.
