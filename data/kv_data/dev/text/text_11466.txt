it is a tetracyclic diterpenoid ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2Z)-2-methylbut-2-enoic (angelic) acid with the 3-hydroxy group of ingenol. Used for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetracyclic diterpenoid, a carboxylic ester and a cyclic terpene ketone. It derives from an angelic acid and an ingenol. it is a selective small-molecule activator of protein kinase C (PKC) isolated from the plant Euphorbia peplus with potential antineoplastic activity. it activates various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, thereby inducing apoptosis in some tumor cells, including myeloid leukemia cells, melanoma cells, and basal cell carcinoma cells. The PKC family consists of signaling isoenzymes that regulate many cell processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
