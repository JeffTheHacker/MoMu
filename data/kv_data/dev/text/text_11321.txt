it is dexamethasone in which the hydroxy group at the 17alpha position is substituted by hydrogen. A synthetic corticosteroid with glucocorticoid activity, it is used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic in the treatment of various skin disorders, including skin allergies and psoriasis. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug and an antipruritic drug. It is an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, a 20-oxo steroid, a fluorinated steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone. it is a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist with metabolic, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity. it activates specific intracellular receptors, which bind to distinct sites on DNA to modify gene transcription. This results in an induction of the synthesis of anti-inflammatory proteins and suppression of the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. This leads to an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions. it is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.
