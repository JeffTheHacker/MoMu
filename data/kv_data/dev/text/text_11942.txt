it is a hydroxamic acid that is N-hydroxyacrylamide which is substituted at position 3 by a 2-butyl-1-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl group (the E isomer). An orally available pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor with demonstrated activity in the treatment of advanced solid tumours. It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and an antimalarial. It is an olefinic compound, a hydroxamic acid, a benzimidazole and a tertiary amino compound. it is an orally available, small-molecule histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits HDACs, which may result in the accumulation of highly acetylated histones, followed by the induction of chromatin remodeling; the selective transcription of tumor suppressor genes; the tumor suppressor protein-mediated inhibition of tumor cell division; and, finally, the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. This agent may possess improved metabolic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties compared to other HDAC inhibitors.
