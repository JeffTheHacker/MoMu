it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT01668823 (Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer). it is a lipophilic, second-generation, chlorin-based photosensitizer. Upon intravenous administration, it selectively accumulates in the cytoplasm of cancer or pre-cancerous cells. When laser light is applied, a photodynamic reaction between it and oxygen occurs, resulting in the production of cytotoxic free radicals and singlet oxygen and free radical-mediated cell death. Compared to the first-generation photosensitizer porfimer sodium, it shows improved pharmacokinetic properties and causes only mild skin photosensitivity which declines rapidly within a few days after administration.
