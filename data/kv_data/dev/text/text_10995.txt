2, 4, 6-Trimethoxybenzophenone, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzophenones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone attached to two phenyl groups. 2, 4, 6-Trimethoxybenzophenone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 4, 6-trimethoxybenzophenone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 4, 6-trimethoxybenzophenone can be found in garden tomato. This makes 2, 4, 6-trimethoxybenzophenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
