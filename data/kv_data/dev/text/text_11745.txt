Taraxasterol, also known as it or a-lactucerol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Taraxasterol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, taraxasterol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, taraxasterol can be found in a number of food items such as alcoholic beverages, burdock, chicory, and carrot. This makes taraxasterol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
