(1S, 2S, 4R, 8R)-p-Menthane-1, 2, 8, 9-tetrol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes (1S, 2S, 4R, 8R)-p-Menthane-1, 2, 8, 9-tetrol is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (1S, 2S, 4R, 8R)-p-menthane-1, 2, 8, 9-tetrol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (1S, 2S, 4R, 8R)-p-menthane-1, 2, 8, 9-tetrol can be found in fats and oils and herbs and spices. This makes (1S, 2S, 4R, 8R)-p-menthane-1, 2, 8, 9-tetrol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
