it is the hydrochloride salt form of ethambutol, an ethylenediamine derivative with antibacterial activity, specifically effective against mycobacteria. Although the exact mechanism of action of ethambutol hydrochloride is unknown, ethambutol hydrochloride inhibits the transfer of mycolic acids into the cell wall of bacteria, which impedes bacterial cell growth. This agent may also interfere with RNA synthesis or inhibit other cell metabolism, thereby preventing cell multiplication and causing cell death.
