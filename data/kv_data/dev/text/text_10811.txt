it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is benzimidalole which is substituted at position 2 by a (methoxycarbonyl)amino group and at position 5 by a 2-thienoyl group. It is an antineoplastic agent that exerts its effect by depolymerising microtubules. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tubulin modulator, an antimitotic and a microtubule-destabilising agent. It is a member of thiophenes, a member of benzimidazoles, a carbamate ester and an aromatic ketone. it is a synthetic tubulin-binding agent with antineoplastic activity. it binds to beta-tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics. This prevents mitosis and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Although it binding site overlaps with that of colchicine, the two agents are structurally quite different.
