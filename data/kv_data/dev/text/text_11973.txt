it, anhydrous appears as a colorless gas smelling of fish at low concentrations and of ammonia at higher concentrations. Shipped as a liquid under its vapor pressure. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite by evaporative cooling and chemical type burns. Density of liquid 5.5 lb / gal. The gas, which is corrosive, dissolves readily in water to form flammable corrosive solutions. The gas is heavier than air and can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Gas is easily ignited and produces toxic oxides of nitrogen when burned. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations or short-term inhalation of low concentrations has adverse health effects. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. Used to make other chemicals and as a solvent. it is a secondary aliphatic amine where both N-substituents are methyl. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a secondary aliphatic amine and a member of methylamines. It is a conjugate base of a dimethylaminium.
