it is the maleate salt form of fluvoxamine, a 2-aminoethyl oxime ether of aralkylketones, with antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulimic activities. Fluvoxamine blocks serotonin reuptake by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake pump of the presynaptic neuronal membrane leading to an increase of serotonin levels within the synaptic cleft. This results in facilitated serotonergic transmission and decreased serotonin turnover leading to antidepressant and antiobsessive-compulsive effects.
