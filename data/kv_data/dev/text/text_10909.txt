it is an N-acyl-1-deoxy-4-hydroxysphinganine in which the acyl group on nitrogen is hexacosanoyl and in which C-1 is substituted by a cyclitolic [(1S,2S,3R,4R,5S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclohexyl] amino group. It is a synthetic analogue of the CD1d-presented agonist alpha-galactosylceramide. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino cyclitol and a N-acyl-1-deoxy-4-hydroxysphinganine.
