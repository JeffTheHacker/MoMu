it, also known as it or 3-(9-adeninyl)propionic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 6-aminopurines. These are purines that carry an amino group at position 6. Purine is a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 6-amino-9H-purine-9-propanoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 6-amino-9H-purine-9-propanoic acid can be found in mushrooms. This makes 6-amino-9H-purine-9-propanoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
