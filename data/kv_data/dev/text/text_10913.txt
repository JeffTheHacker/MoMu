DG(10:0/0:0/10:0), also known as diacylglycerol(20:0) or 1, 3-dicaprin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3-diacylglycerols. These are diacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at positions 1 and 3. DG(10:0/0:0/10:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, DG(10:0/0:0/10:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
