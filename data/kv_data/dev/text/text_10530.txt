it, also known as bornyl methanoate or fema 2161, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, bornyl formate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a balsam, earthy, and green tasting compound that can be found in rosemary. This makes bornyl formate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
