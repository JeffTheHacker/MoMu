it is under investigation for the treatment of Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits the activity of mTOR, which may result in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase that is upregulated in a variety of tumors, plays an important role downstream in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
