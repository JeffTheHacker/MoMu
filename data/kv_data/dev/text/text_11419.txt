it is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 7, 4' and 5' and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 3' respectively. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavanone glycoside, a tetrahydroxyflavanone, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones.
