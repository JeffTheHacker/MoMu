it is a hydrate that is the trihydrate form of amoxicillin; a semisynthetic antibiotic, used either alone or in combination with potassium clavulanate (under the trade name Augmentin) for treatment of a variety of bacterial infections. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and an antimicrobial agent. It contains an amoxicillin. Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum, semisynthetic aminopenicillin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. Amoxicillin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1A located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
