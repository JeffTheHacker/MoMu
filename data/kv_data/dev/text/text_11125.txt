it is a member of the class of thiazolidines that is (4R)-3-methyl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid which is substituted at position 2 by a (4R)-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-4-yl group. A siderophore that is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (via condensation of salicylic acid and two molecules of cysteine) as a mixture of two easily interconvertible diastereoisomers, it I (major) and it II (minor). The enantiomeric compounds, enant-it, are produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. It has a role as a siderophore and a metabolite. It is a member of phenols, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of thiazolidines.
