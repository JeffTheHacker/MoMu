Levomilnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used to treat major depressive disorders. Levomilnacipran is an enantiomer of milnacipran, which is used to treat fibromyalgia. Levomilnacipran and milnacipran have been associated with a low rate of transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during treatment and with rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury with jaundice.
