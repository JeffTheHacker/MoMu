it is a C19-gibberellin, initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi; it differs from gibberellin A1 in the absence of an OH group at C-7 and the substitution of the methylidene grouping at C-8 by alpha-OH and beta-Me groups (gibbane numberings). It is a C19-gibberellin, a lactone and a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid.
