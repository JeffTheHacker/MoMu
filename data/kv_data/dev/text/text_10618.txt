it is a highly branched amino nonasaccharide consisting of a D-GlcNAc residue at the reducing end with a beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->6)]-[beta-D-Xyl-(1->2)]-beta-D-Man-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc moiety attached via a beta-(1->4)-linkage and an L-Fuc residue attached via an alpha-(1->3)-linkage. Found on Cry j 1, the major allergen of Cryptomeria japonica pollen. It has a role as a carbohydrate allergen. It is an oligosaccharide derivative, an amino nonasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
