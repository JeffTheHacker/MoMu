it is a phenylalanine derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of L-phenylalanine with the carboxy group of (3R)-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-2-benzopyran-7-carboxylic acid. it differs from the more naturally abundant ochratoxin A in the absence of the dihydroisocoumarin chlorine atom. It has cytotoxic effects on kidney and liver cells in vitro but only minor effects in vivo, due to its rapid metabolism and excretion. It inhibits cell proliferation of human liver HepG2 cells at doses as low as 1 mug/ ml but lacks the genotoxic activity of ochratoxin A, even at higher concentrations. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite, a Penicillium metabolite, a mycotoxin and a calcium channel blocker. It is a phenylalanine derivative, a N-acyl-L-phenylalanine and a member of isochromanes.
