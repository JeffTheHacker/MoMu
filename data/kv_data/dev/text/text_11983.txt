Xi-2, 5-dimethyltridecane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. Xi-2, 5-dimethyltridecane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xi-2, 5-dimethyltridecane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, xi-2, 5-dimethyltridecane can be found in brassicas. This makes xi-2, 5-dimethyltridecane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
