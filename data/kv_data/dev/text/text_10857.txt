it appears as a white colored liquid with the odor of moth balls. Denser than water and insoluble in water. Flash point below 200Â°F. Used as a moth repellent, to make other chemicals, as a fumigant, and for many other uses. it is a dichlorobenzene carrying chloro groups at positions 1 and 4. It has a role as an insecticide. it is a synthetic, white crystalline solid that is practically insoluble in water and soluble in ether, chloroform, carbon disulfide, benzene, alcohol and acetone. It is used primarily as a space deodorant in products such as room deodorizers, urinal and toilet bowl blocks, and as an insecticide fumigant for moth control. When it is heated to decomposition, toxic gases and vapors (such as hydrochloric acid and carbon monoxide) are released. The primary route of potential human exposure to this compound is inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure to it can result in coughing and breathing difficulties. Breathing high levels of this chemical can cause headaches, dizziness and liver damage. Contact with it can irritate the eyes, leading to burning and tearing. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
