Arbutin, also known as arbutoside or beta-arbutin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenolic glycosides. These are organic compounds containing a phenolic structure attached to a glycosyl moiety. Some examples of phenolic structures include lignans, and flavonoids. Among the sugar units found in natural glycosides are D-glucose, L-Fructose, and L rhamnose. Arbutin exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, arbutin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Arbutin is a bitter tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as apple, pomes, lingonberry, and sweet marjoram. This makes arbutin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
