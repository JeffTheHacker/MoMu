1, 1-Dihexyloxyethane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetals. Acetals are compounds having the structure R2C(OR')2 ( R' not Hydrogen) and thus diethers of geminal diols. Originally, the term was confined to derivatives of aldehydes (one R = H), but it now applies equally to derivatives of ketones (neither R = H ). Mixed acetals have different R' groups. 1, 1-Dihexyloxyethane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 1-dihexyloxyethane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 1, 1-Dihexyloxyethane is a sweet, ethereal, and green tasting compound that can be found in fruits. This makes 1, 1-dihexyloxyethane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
