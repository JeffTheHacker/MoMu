ATP is an adenosine 5'-phosphate in which the 5'-phosphate is a triphosphate group. It is involved in the transportation of chemical energy during metabolic pathways. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a micronutrient, a fundamental metabolite and a cofactor. It is an adenosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate. It is a conjugate acid of an ATP(3-). it is an adenine nucleotide comprised of three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety, found in all living cells. it is involved in energy production for metabolic processes and RNA synthesis. In addition, this substance acts as a neurotransmitter. In cancer studies, it is synthesized to examine its use to decrease weight loss and improve muscle strength.
