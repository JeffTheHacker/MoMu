The serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are potent antiemetics used for prevention of postsurgical or chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and for some agents as therapy of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are associated with a low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but have been only rarely implicated in cases of clinically apparent liver injury. it is an indole derivative and a potent serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with anti-emetic property. it blocks the activity of serotonin released from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by selectively inhibiting and inactivating 5-HT3 receptors located on the nerve terminals of the vagus nerve in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. This results in suppression of signalling to trigger chemo- and radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
