it is a glucosaminoglycan consisting of L-asparagine having the heptasaccharide alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Man-(1->6)]-alpha-D-Man-(1->6)]-beta-D-Man-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc attached at the N(4)-position It is a N(4)-glycosyl-L-asparagine, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosaminoglycan. It derives from an alpha-D-Manp-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1->6)]-alpha-D-Manp-(1->6)]-beta-D-Manp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
