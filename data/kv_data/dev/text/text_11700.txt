it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 6-prenylated flavones. These are flavones that features a C5-isoprenoid substituent at the 6-position. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
