Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin that includes an N-oxime side chain on the lactone ring, with antibacterial and anti-malarial activities. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and leads to inhibition of bacterial cell growth and replication.
