Laurolitsine, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aporphines. These are quinoline alkaloids containing the dibenzo[de, g]quinoline ring system or a dehydrogenated derivative thereof. Laurolitsine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, laurolitsine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
