Congmuyenoside a, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpene saponins. These are glycosylated derivatives of triterpene sapogenins. The sapogenin moiety backbone is usually based on the oleanane, ursane, taraxastane, bauerane, lanostane, lupeol, lupane, dammarane, cycloartane, friedelane, hopane, 9b, 19-cyclo-lanostane, cycloartane, or cycloartanol skeleton. Congmuyenoside a exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, congmuyenoside a is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, congmuyenoside a can be found in green vegetables. This makes congmuyenoside a a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
