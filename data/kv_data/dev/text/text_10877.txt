it is the hydrochloride salt form of maprotiline, a tetracyclic antidepressant closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants with adrenergic activity and sedative properties. it exerts its effect by blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine, thereby increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine in the central nervous system and subsequently prolonging the action of norepinephrine on central receptors.
