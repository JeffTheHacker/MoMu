it is a dipeptide formed from L-arginine and L-phenylalaninamide residues in which a hydrogen attached to the nitrogen of the alpha-amino group of the arginine residue has been replaced by a 1-adamantanecarbonyl group. It has been reported to be a potent and selective antagonist of neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptors, but more recently found to be an agonist at both NPFF1R and the kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R). It has a role as a neuropeptide FF receptor antagonist, a neuropeptide FF receptor agonist and a kisspeptin receptor agonist. It derives from an Arg-Ala.
