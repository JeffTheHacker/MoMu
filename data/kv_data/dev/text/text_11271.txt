it is the hydrochloride salt form of terazosin, a quinazoline derivative with adrenergic antagonistic property. it selectively inhibits alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, resulting in vasodilation leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduced venous return to the heart as well as decreased urethral resistance, which potentially improving urine flow and symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In addition, terazosin decreases low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides while increasing the concentration of high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
