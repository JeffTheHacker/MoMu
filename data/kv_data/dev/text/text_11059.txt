it is an alpha-tocopherol ester of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA or tretinoin), with skin healing, differentiation inducing and anti-leukemia activities. By stimulating the formation of tissue granulation and wound healing, it promotes the healing of skin ulcers. In addition, this agent induces the granulocytic differentiation of human leukemia cells and inhibits cellular proliferation. Tretinoin tocoferil does not induce teratogenesis and is less toxic than ATRA.
