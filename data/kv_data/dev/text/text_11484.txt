Cocaethylene, also known as it or ethylcocaine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzoic acid esters. These are ester derivatives of benzoic acid. Cocaethylene is slightly soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Cocaethylene has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, cocaethylene is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
