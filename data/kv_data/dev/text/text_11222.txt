Beta-it, also known as B-elemenone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Beta-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Beta-elemenone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Beta-elemenone can be found in herbs and spices. This makes Beta-elemenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
