Sclareol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Sclareol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, sclareol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Sclareol is a sweet, amber, and balsam tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as nutmeg, herbs and spices, common thyme, and tea. This makes sclareol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
