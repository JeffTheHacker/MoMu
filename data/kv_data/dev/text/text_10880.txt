it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Kidney Neoplasms, Colorectal Neoplasms, Metastases, Neoplasm, and Carcinoma, Renal Cell. Vascular Disrupting Agent it is a water-soluble phosphate prodrug of N-acetylcolchinol with potential antiangiogenesis and antineoplastic activities. it is converted in vivo into N-acetylcolchinol. N-acetylcolchinol binds to and destabilizes the tubulin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels, which may result in tumor endothelial cell apoptosis, the selective occlusion of tumor blood vessels, cessation of tumor blood flow, and tumor necrosis.
