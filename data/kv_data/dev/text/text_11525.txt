it is the L-enantiomer of selenomethionine. It is an enantiomer of a D-selenomethionine. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is the amino acid methionine with selenium substituting for the sulphur moiety. Methionine is an essential amino acid in humans, whereas selenium is a free-radical scavenging anti-oxidant, essential for the protection of various tissues from the damages of lipid peroxidation. As a trace mineral that is toxic in high doses, selenium is a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, an anti-oxidant enzyme that neutralizes hydrogen peroxide. it is considered a safe, efficacious form of selenium and is readily bioavailable. Selenium may be chemoprotective for certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer. (NCI04)
