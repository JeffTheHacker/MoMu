Ubiquinone-6, also known as coenzyme Q6 or coq-6, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ubiquinones. These are coenzyme Q derivatives containing a 5, 6-dimethoxy-3-methyl(1, 4-benzoquinone) moiety to which an isoprenyl group is attached at ring position 2(or 6). Ubiquinone-6 exists as a liquid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Ubiquinone-6 has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, ubiquinone-6 is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Ubiquinone-6 exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, ubiquinone-6 is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway.
