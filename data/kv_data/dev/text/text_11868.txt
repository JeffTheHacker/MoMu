Etoposide and it are semisynthetic analogues of podophyllotoxin that are used as antineoplastic agents in the therapy of several forms of solid tumors, leukemia and lymphoma, usually in combination with other agents. Both etoposide and it are associated with an appreciable rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, and high doses have been implicated in causing clinically apparent acute liver injury including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Teniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with antineoplastic activity. Teniposide forms a ternary complex with the enzyme topoisomerase II and DNA, resulting in dose-dependent single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA, DNA: protein cross-links, inhibition of DNA strand religation, and cytotoxicity. This agent acts in the late S or early G phase of the cell cycle. (NCI04)
