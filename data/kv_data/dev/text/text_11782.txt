Alizapride, also known as plitican or vergentan, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzotriazoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene fused to a triazole ring (a five-membered ring with two carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms). Alizapride exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Alizapride has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, alizapride is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
