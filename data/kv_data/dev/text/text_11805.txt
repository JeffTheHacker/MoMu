Panaxatriol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Panaxatriol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, panaxatriol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, panaxatriol can be found in beverages. This makes panaxatriol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
