Homatropine Hydrobromide is the hydrobromide salt form of homatropine, a synthetic tertiary amine alkaloid with antimuscarinic properties. Homatropine, a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor, blocks parasympathetic nerve stimulation. When applied topically to the eye, dilation of the pupil (mydriasis) and paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) result from the local anticholinergic effects on the ciliary muscle and iris.
