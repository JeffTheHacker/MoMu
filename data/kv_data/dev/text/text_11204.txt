it is a dibenzothiazepine, a N-alkylpiperazine and a N-arylpiperazine. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist, a dopaminergic antagonist, a histamine antagonist, an adrenergic antagonist and a second generation antipsychotic. it is a dibenzothiazepine derivative with antipsychotic property. it fumarate antagonizes serotonin activity mediated by 5-HT 1A and 5-HT2 receptors. With a lower affinity, this agent also reversibly binds to dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the mesolimbic and mesocortical areas of the brain leading to decreased psychotic effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. In addition, it also binds to other alpha-1, alpha-2 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
