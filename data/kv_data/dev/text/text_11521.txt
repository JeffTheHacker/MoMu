it is a hydrochloride salt prepared from equimolar amounts of pazopanib and hydrochloric acid. Used for treatment of kidney cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It contains a pazopanib(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt of a small molecule inhibitor of multiple protein tyrosine kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. Pazopanib selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2 and -3, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), which may result in inhibition of angiogenesis in tumors in which these receptors are upregulated.
