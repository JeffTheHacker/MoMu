1, 1-Dimethoxyoctane, also known as C-8 dimethylacetal or fema 2798, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetals. Acetals are compounds having the structure R2C(OR')2 ( R' not Hydrogen) and thus diethers of geminal diols. Originally, the term was confined to derivatives of aldehydes (one R = H), but it now applies equally to derivatives of ketones (neither R = H ). Mixed acetals have different R' groups. 1, 1-Dimethoxyoctane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 1-dimethoxyoctane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 1, 1-Dimethoxyoctane has a citrus, floral, and green taste.
