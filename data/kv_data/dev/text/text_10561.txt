it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1H-benzimidazole which is substituted by a (2R,4S)-4-{[(4-cyanophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-1-methylpiperidin-2-yl group at position 2. It is a hedgehog signalling pathway inhibitor that acts by binding to Smoothened (SMO) receptors and blocking signal transduction (IC50 = 5 nM). It is used in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult patients (aged >= 75 years), or who have medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy. It has a role as a SMO receptor antagonist, a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a member of piperidines, a member of phenylureas and a nitrile. it is an orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway with potential antineoplastic activity. it appears to inhibit Hh pathway signaling. The Hh signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair. Constitutive activation of Hh pathway signaling has been observed in various types of malignancies.
