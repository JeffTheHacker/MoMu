it is a penicillin. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. it is a semi-synthetic beta-lactam aminocyclohexylpenicillin antibiotic. it is bactericidal and binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins, thereby inhibiting transpeptidation during peptidoglycan synthesis. This leads to an interruption of the bacterial cell wall, causing instability of bacterial cell wall and results in cell lysis. it is beta-lactamase susceptible.
