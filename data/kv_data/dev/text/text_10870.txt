it, also known as it or PQ 5, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as epoxides. Epoxides are compounds containing a cyclic ether with three ring atoms(one oxygen and two carbon atoms). it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, panaquinquecol 5 is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, panaquinquecol 5 can be found in tea. This makes panaquinquecol 5 a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
