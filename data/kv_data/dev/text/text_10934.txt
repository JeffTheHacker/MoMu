it is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-chlorobenzoic acid with the amino group of 2-[4-(2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]-2-methylpropanoic acid. Benafibrate is used for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an antilipemic drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid, an aromatic ether, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a propionic acid. it is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) with antilipidemic activity. it decreases triglyceride levels, increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and decreases total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.
