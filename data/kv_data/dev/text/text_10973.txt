it, also known as 4-cppo, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpiperidines. Phenylpiperidines are compounds containing a phenylpiperidine skeleton, which consists of a piperidine bound to a phenyl group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
