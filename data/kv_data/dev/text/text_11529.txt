it is an aminoquinoline that consists of quinoline in which the hydrogen at position 2 is substituted by a 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl group. A 5-HT3 agonist. Has almost the same affinity for 5-HT3 sites as quipazine but unlike the latter, does not bind to 5-HT1B sites. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine and an aminoquinoline.
