it is a hydrochloride salt resulting from the reaction of benazepril with 1 mol eq. of hydrogen chloride. It is used as a prodrug for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazeprilat in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It contains a benazepril(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt of benazepril, a carboxyl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, benazepril is metabolized to its active form benazeprilat. Benazeprilat competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation. Benazeprilat also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
