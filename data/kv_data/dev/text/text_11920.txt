it is a mixture of valproic acid and its sodium salt in a 1:1 molar ratio. It is used for the management and treatment of seizure disorders, mania, and prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. It has a role as an antimanic drug, an anticonvulsant and a GABA agent. It contains a valproic acid and a sodium valproate. it is a stable coordination compound comprised of sodium valproate and valproic acid with anticonvulsant and antiepileptic activities. Divalproex dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. This agent binds to and inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase and its anticonvulsant activity may be exerted by increasing brain concentration of GABA and by inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Divalproex may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels.
