it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a piperidin-4-yl group, which in turn is substituted on the nitrogen by a 4,4-bis(p-fluorophenyl)butyl group. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a first generation antipsychotic, an antidyskinesia agent and a dopaminergic antagonist. It is a member of benzimidazoles, an organofluorine compound and a heteroarylpiperidine. it is a diphenylbutylpiperidine derivative and a dopamine antagonist with antipsychotic property. it selectively inhibits type 2 dopaminergic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby decreasing dopamine neurotransmission and reducing the occurrence of motor and vocal tics and delusions of parasitosis. In addition, this agent antagonizes alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors.
