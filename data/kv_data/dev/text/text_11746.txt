Gamma-Muurolene, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Gamma-Muurolene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Gamma-Muurolene has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, Gamma-muurolene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Gamma-Muurolene is a herbal, spice, and woody tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as oat, cloves, carrot, and winter savory. This makes Gamma-muurolene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
