Imazamethabenz-methyl, also known as ac 222293 or antibiotic am 630B, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzoic acid esters. These are ester derivatives of benzoic acid. Imazamethabenz-methyl exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, imazamethabenz-methyl is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
