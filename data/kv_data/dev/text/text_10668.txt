it is a member of the class of triazoles that is 1-butyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole in which the butyl group is substituted at positions 2, 2, and 3 by hydroxy, 2,4-difluorophenyl, and 4-(p-cyanophenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl groups, respectively (the R,R stereoisomer). It exhibits antifungal activity by inhibition of 14alpha demethylase, an enzyme involved in sterol synthesis, resulting in lysis of the fungal cell wall and fungal cell death. (NCIO4) It has a role as an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor, an antifungal drug, an EC 1.14.14.154 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antileishmanial agent. It is a member of triazoles, a member of fluorobenzenes, a tertiary alcohol, a member of 1,3-thiazoles and a nitrile. it is a triazole with antifungal activity. it inhibits 14a demethylase, an enzyme involved in sterol synthesis, resulting in lysis of the fungal cell wall and fungal cell death.
