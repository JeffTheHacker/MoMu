2, 6-Di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol, also known as nocrac m 17 or 4-ethyl-2, 6-di-tert-butylphenol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety. 2, 6-Di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol can be found in fruits and tea. This makes 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. 2, 6-Di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol is a potentially toxic compound.
