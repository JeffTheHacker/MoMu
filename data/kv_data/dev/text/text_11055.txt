2-Methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-), also known as (e)-2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA or tiglyl-coenzyme A, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. 2-Methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-) is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 2-Methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-) has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-) is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-) can be found in a number of food items such as pak choy, other bread, cascade huckleberry, and soy bean. This makes 2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA(4-) a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
