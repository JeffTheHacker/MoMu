it is a monosaccharide derivative that consists of multifidol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 1 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Acacia mearnsii, it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an anti-inflammatory agent and a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor. It is a butanone, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of resorcinols and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a multifidol.
