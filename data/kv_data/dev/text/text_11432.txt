it is a member of the class of dihydroflavonols that is (+)-dihydrokaempferol substituted by a prenyl group at position 8 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Phellodendron amurense and Commiphora africana, it exhibits inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a member of dihydroflavonols, a flavanone glycoside, a trihydroxyflavanone, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from a (+)-dihydrokaempferol.
