it is the calcium salt form of fosamprenavir, prodrug of amprenavir, and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor with antiviral property. Fosamprenavir is converted to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the epithelial cells of the intestine. Then amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the proteolytic cleavage of viral Gag-Pol polypeptide into individual functional proteins, thereby leading to the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.
