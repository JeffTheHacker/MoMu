Acrylyl-CoA, also known as acryloyl-CoA or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Acrylyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Acrylyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, acrylyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, acrylyl-CoA is involved in the propanoate metabolism pathway. Acrylyl-CoA is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, the malonic aciduria pathway, and the methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders pathway.
