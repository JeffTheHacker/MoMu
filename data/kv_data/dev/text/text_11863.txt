it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkaloids and derivatives. These are naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms. This group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly acidic properties. Also some synthetic compounds of similar structure are attributed to alkaloids. In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and more rarely other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from nicotine through the action of the enzymes cytochrome P450 2A6 and cytochrome P450 2B6. In addition, it can be converted into cotinine through its interaction with the enzyme aldehyde oxidase. In humans, it is involved in the nicotine metabolism pathway and the nicotine action pathway.
