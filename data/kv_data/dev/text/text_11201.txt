1, 2, 4, 5-Tetrathiane, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrathianes. These are organic compounds containing a tetrathiane ring, which is a six-member saturated aliphatic ring made up of four sulfur atoms and two carbon atoms. Within the cell, 1, 2, 4, 5-tetrathiane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 4, 5-tetrathiane can be found in mushrooms. This makes 1, 2, 4, 5-tetrathiane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
