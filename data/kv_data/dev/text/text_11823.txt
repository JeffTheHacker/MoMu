Sesamolin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzodioxoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to either isomers of dioxole. Dioxole is a five-membered unsaturated ring of two oxygen atoms and three carbon atoms. Sesamolin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, sesamolin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, sesamolin can be found in fats and oils, flaxseed, and sesame. This makes sesamolin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
