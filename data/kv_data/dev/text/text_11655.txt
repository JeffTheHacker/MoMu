it is a pyrrolopyridine that is 5-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine which is substituted by a [6-({[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl]methyl}amino)pyridin-3-yl]methyl group at position 3. It is a potent multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of CSF-1R, KIT, and FLT3 (IC50 of 20 nM, 10 nM and 160 nM, respectively). Approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pyrrolopyridine, an organochlorine compound, an aminopyridine, an organofluorine compound and a secondary amino compound. it is a small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor of proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), with antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, it targets, binds to and inhibits phosphorylation of KIT, CSF1R and FLT3 harboring an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. This results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. FLT3, CSF1R and FLT3 are overexpressed or mutated in many cancer cell types and play major roles in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.
