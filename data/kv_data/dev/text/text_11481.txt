it is a synthetic piperidine derivative, effective against diarrhoea resulting from gastroenteritis or inflammatory bowel disease. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an antidiarrhoeal drug and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of piperidines, a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a tertiary alcohol. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a synthetic agent chemically related to the opiates with anti-diarrheal properties. it decreases gastro-intestinal motility by effects on the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestine. Part of its anti-diarrheal effect may be due to a reduction of gastro-intestinal secretion produced by opioid receptor binding in the intestinal mucosa. (NCI04)
