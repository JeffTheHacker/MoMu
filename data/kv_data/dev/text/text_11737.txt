it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxanes. Oxanes are compounds containing an oxane (tetrahydropyran) ring, which is a six-member saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, sesquicineol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
