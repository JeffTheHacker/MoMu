(Z)-Oak lactone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom (Z)-Oak lactone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (Z)-oak lactone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
