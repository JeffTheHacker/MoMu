it is a member of the class of pyrazines resulting from the formal monoacylation of guanidine with the carboxy group of 3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carboxylic acid. It has a role as a sodium channel blocker and a diuretic. It is a member of pyrazines, an organochlorine compound, an aromatic amine and a member of guanidines. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a synthetic pyrazine derivative with antikaliuretic and diuretic properties. it inhibits sodium channels located in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, thereby preventing the absorption of sodium and increasing its excretion along with water, to produce naturesis. In response to the hypernatremic conditions in the kidney, the plasma membrane becomes hyperpolarized and electrochemical forces are reduced, which then prevents the excretion of potassium and hydrogen into the lumen.
