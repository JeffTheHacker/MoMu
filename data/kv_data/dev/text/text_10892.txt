it is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]benzoic acid with the primary aromatic amino group of 4-methyl-N(3)-[4-(pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl]benzene-1,3-diamine. Used (as its mesylate salt) for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a N-methylpiperazine, a member of pyridines, a member of benzamides, an aromatic amine and a member of pyrimidines. It derives from a benzamide. it is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits the Bcr-Abl fusion protein tyrosine kinase, an abnormal enzyme produced by chronic myeloid leukemia cells that contain the Philadelphia chromosome. it also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit; the SCF/c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase is activated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This agent inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cells that overexpress these oncoproteins.
