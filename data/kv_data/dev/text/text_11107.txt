Romidepsin is an intravenously administered histone deacetylase inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is approved for use in refractory or relapsed cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphomas. Romidepsin is associated with modest rate of minor serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury, although it has been reported to cause reactivation of hepatitis B.
