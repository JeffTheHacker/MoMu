it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 2-aminobenzimidazole in which the primary amino group is substituted by a methoxycarbonyl group. A fungicide, it controls Ascomycetes, Fungi Imperfecti, and Basidiomycetes on a wide variety of crops, including bananas, cereals, cotton, fruits, grapes, mushrooms, ornamentals, peanuts, sugarbeet, soybeans, tobacco, and vegetables. It has a role as an antinematodal drug, a metabolite, a microtubule-destabilising agent and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a carbamate ester, a member of benzimidazoles, a benzimidazole fungicide and a benzimidazolylcarbamate fungicide. It derives from a 2-aminobenzimidazole. it is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole antifungal with potential antimitotic and antineoplastic activities. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it appears to binds to an unspecified site on tubulin and suppresses microtubule assembly dynamic. This results in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and an induction of apoptosis.
