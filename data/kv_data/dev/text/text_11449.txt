it is a tertiary amino compound that is 2-(aminomethyl)-N,N-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine in which the primary ammino groups have each been acylated by condensation with the carboxy group of 2-{3-[(1R)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-hydroxypropyl]phenoxy}acetic acid, the hydroxy groups of which have been esterified by condensation with the carboxy group of L-pipecolic acid, the nitrogen of which has been acylated by condensation with (2S)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)butyric acid. It is a synthetic, cell-permeable ligand that can be used to induce homodimerization of fusion proteins containing the DmrB domain. It has a role as a ligand. It is a N-acylpiperidine, a carboxylic ester, an aromatic ether and a tertiary amino compound.
