N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine is very soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine N-oxide can be biosynthesized from mycophenolate mofetil; which is mediated by the enzyme cocaine esterase. In addition, N-(2-Carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine N-oxide can be biosynthesized from mycophenolate mofetil; which is catalyzed by the enzymes liver carboxylesterase 1 and cocaine esterase. In humans, N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine is involved in the mycophenolic Acid metabolism pathway.
