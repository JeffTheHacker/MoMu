it is the acetate salt form of cortisone, a synthetic or semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring cortisone hormone produced by the adrenal glands with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. it diffuses through the cell membrane and binds to nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. The receptor-ligand complex binds to promotor regions of certain genes and initiates RNA transcription. This results in an induction of synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins while inhibiting the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators.
