Alpha-Viniferin, also known as Î-viniferin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-arylbenzofuran flavonoids. These are phenylpropanoids containing the 2-phenylbenzofuran moiety. Alpha-Viniferin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-viniferin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, Alpha-viniferin can be found in alcoholic beverages, common grape, and fruits. This makes Alpha-viniferin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
