it is a low molecular weight quinazolinone alkaloid, and a potent inhibitor of collagen alpha1(I) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) gene expression. it also effectively suppresses tumor progression and metastasis in mice. Collgard Biopharmaceuticals is developing halofuginone for the treatment of scleroderma and received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March, 2000. it is an orally-active quinazolinone alkaloid with potential antineoplastic activity. it interferes with the signaling pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and inhibits expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2, thereby inhibiting collagen type I synthesis and inducing extracellular matrix degradation, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor growth, or metastasis.
