it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Cancer, Melanoma, Prostate Cancer, Gastric Carcinoma, and Advanced Melanoma, among others. it is a semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and thereby preventing microtubule depolymerization. This may lead to cell cycle arrest and an inhibition of cell proliferation. This agent may also inhibit pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors.
