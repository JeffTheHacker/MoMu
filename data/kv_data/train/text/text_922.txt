Methyl dopa appears as colorless or almost colorless crystals or white to yellowish-white fine powder. Almost tasteless. In the sesquihydrate form. pH (saturated aqueous solution) about 5.0. (NTP, 1992) Alpha-methyl-L-dopa is a derivative of L-tyrosine having a methyl group at the alpha-position and an additional hydroxy group at the 3-position on the phenyl ring. It has a role as a hapten, an antihypertensive agent, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a peripheral nervous system drug and a sympatholytic agent. It is a L-tyrosine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. it is a phenylalanine derivative and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it is a prodrug and is metabolized in the central nervous system. The antihypertensive action of it seems to be attributable to its conversion into alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which is a potent alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that binds to and stimulates potent central inhibitory alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. This results in a decrease in sympathetic outflow and decreased blood pressure.
