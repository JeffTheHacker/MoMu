2, 4, 6-Trimethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane, also known as thioacetaldehyde or 1, 3, 5-trithiane, 2, 4, 6-trimethyl, #1, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trithianes. These are organic compounds containing a six-member aliphatic saturated heterocycle made up of three sulfur atoms and three carbon atoms. 2, 4, 6-Trimethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 4, 6-trimethyl-1, 3, 5-trithiane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
