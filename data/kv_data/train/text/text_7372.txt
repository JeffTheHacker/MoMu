it is a cyclic ketone that is 3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1-one substituted at position 5 by a 3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy group (the S-enantiomer). A non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist used (as its hydrochloride salt) for treatment of glaucoma. It has a role as an antiglaucoma drug and a beta-adrenergic antagonist. It is a propanolamine, a cyclic ketone and an aromatic ether. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1+). It derives from a hydride of a tetralin. it is a naphthalenone and non-cardioselective adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist with anti-glaucoma activity. Upon administration in the eye, it blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby causing vasoconstriction. it also decreases ciliary's body production of aqueous humor, leading to a decrease in aqueous humor.
