Isopropyl dodecanoic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. Isopropyl dodecanoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Isopropyl dodecanoic acid has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as saliva and urine. Within the cell, isopropyl dodecanoic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
