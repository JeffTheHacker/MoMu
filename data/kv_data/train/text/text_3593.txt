Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progesterone that is used for emergency contraception. Levonorgestrel is also used alone and in combination with estrogens in conventional oral contraceptives. Use of levonorgestrel for emergency contraception has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. it is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with anti-progesterone activity. it binds to the progesterone receptor (PR), thereby inhibiting PR-mediated gene expression, and interfering with progesterone activity in the reproductive system. As a result, this agent may suppress the growth of uterine leiomyomatosis. Furthermore, by inhibiting or delaying ovulation and effecting endometrial tissue, it can be used as an emergency contraception.
