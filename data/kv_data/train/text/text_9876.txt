Panaxadiol, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Panaxadiol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, panaxadiol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, panaxadiol can be found in tea. This makes panaxadiol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
