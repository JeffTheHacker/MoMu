Quassimarin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quassinoids. These are a group of compounds chemically degraded from triterpenes. According to their basic skeleton, quassinoids are categorized into five distinct groups, C-18, C-19, C-20, C-22 and C-25 types. The C-20 quassinoids can be further classified into two types, tetracyclic and the pentacyclic. The tetracyclic variety does not have oxygenation at C-20, while the pentacyclic quassinoids possess additional oxygenation at C-20 that allows for the formation of an additional ring. Quassimarin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, quassimarin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
