it is a biflavonoid resulting from the formal oxidative dimerisation between position 8 of one molecule of 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone and the 3' position of another. Found in the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, it is a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.35 (gelatinase B) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a biflavonoid and an aromatic ether. It derives from a 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone.
