it is a long-acting, synthetic peptide with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonistic properties. it targets and blocks GnRH receptors located on the surfaces of gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary, thereby reducing secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) by pituitary gonadotroph cells and so decreasing testosterone production by interstitial (Leydig) cells in the testes.
