it is a member of chromanes and a thiazolidinone. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, an antioxidant, a vasodilator agent, an anticonvulsant, an anticoagulant, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. it is an orally-active thiazolidinedione with antidiabetic and hepatotoxic properties and potential antineoplastic activity. it activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a ligand-activated transcription factor, thereby inducing cell differentiation and inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis. This agent also modulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes, inhibits macrophage and monocyte activation, and stimulates adipocyte differentiation. (NCI04)
