(S)-p-Mentha-1, 8-dien-10-yl acetate belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes (S)-p-Mentha-1, 8-dien-10-yl acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (S)-p-mentha-1, 8-dien-10-yl acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm (S)-p-Mentha-1, 8-dien-10-yl acetate is a mild, sweet, and fruity tasting compound that can be found in citrus, fats and oils, and lemon. This makes (S)-p-mentha-1, 8-dien-10-yl acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
