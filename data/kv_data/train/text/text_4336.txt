it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pterocarpans. These are benzo-pyrano-furano-benzene compounds, containing the 6H-[1]benzofuro[3, 2-c]chromene skeleton. They are derivatives of isoflavonoids. Thus, erybraedin a is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, erybraedin a is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, erybraedin a can be found in lima bean and pulses. This makes erybraedin a a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
