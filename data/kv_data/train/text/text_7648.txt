it is a semisynthetic opioid of formula C18H21NO4 that is derived from thebaine. It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic, generally used for relief of moderate to severe pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a semisynthetic derivative. It derives from a thebaine. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan. it is a semi-synthetic, morphine-like opioid alkaloid with analgesic activity. it exerts its analgesic activity by binding to the mu-receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opioids. Binding of the opiate receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby preventing cAMP production. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, is inhibited. it also inhibits the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. In addition, it closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels resulting in hyperpolarization and reduction of neuronal excitability.
