it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Cancer, Lymphoma, Solid Tumors, Advanced Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer, among others. it is a racemic mixture of the enantiomers of a synthetic alpha-lipoic lipoic acid analogue with potential chemopreventive and antineoplastic activities. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, devimistat has been shown to inhibit metabolic and regulatory processes required for cell growth in solid tumors. Both enantiomers in the racemic mixture exhibit antineoplastic activity.
