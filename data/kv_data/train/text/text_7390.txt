4-(4-Chloro-1-{4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]phenyl}-2-phenylbut-1-en-1-yl)phenol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. 4-(4-Chloro-1-{4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]phenyl}-2-phenylbut-1-en-1-yl)phenol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
