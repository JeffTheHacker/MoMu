it appears as a colorless to yellow odorless syrupy liquid. Corrosive to metals and tissue. Used to make cultured dairy products, as a food preservative, and to make chemicals. it is a 2-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is propanoic acid in which one of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as a Daphnia magna metabolite and an algal metabolite. It derives from a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a lactate. it, DL- is the racemic isomer of it, the biologically active isoform in humans. it or lactate is produced during fermentation from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. This reaction, in addition to producing it, also produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) that is then used in glycolysis to produce energy source adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
