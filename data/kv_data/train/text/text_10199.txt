it was approved by the FDA for use in germline BRCA mutated, HER2 negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer on October 16, 2018 under the trade name Talzenna. Talzenna was granted approval based on the results of the EMBRACA trial in which it resulted in a mean 8.6 months progression-free survival time versus physician's choice chemotherapy which resulted in 5.6 months progression-free survival. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to PARP and prevents PARP-mediated DNA repair of single strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair pathway. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and eventually leads to apoptosis. PARP catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins that signal and recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA and is activated by single-strand DNA breaks.
