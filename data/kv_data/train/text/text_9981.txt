p-Menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. p-Menth-1-en-9-ol acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. p-Menth-1-en-9-ol acetate is a fruity, herbal, and spicy tasting compound that can be found in mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine) and spearmint. This makes p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
