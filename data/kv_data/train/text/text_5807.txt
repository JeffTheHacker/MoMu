it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Lymphoma, Liposarcoma, Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma, and Recurrent Thyroid Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable thiazolidinedione and an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and activates PPAR-gamma thus inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis, leading to a reduction in cellular proliferation. PPAR-gamma is a nuclear hormone receptor and a ligand-activated transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in macromolecule metabolism and cell differentiation, specifically adipocyte differentiation.
