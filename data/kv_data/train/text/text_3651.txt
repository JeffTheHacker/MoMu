it is an indazole substituted at position 3 by a 2-(pyridin-2-yl)vinyl group and at position 6 by a 2-(N-methylaminocarboxy)phenylsulfanyl group. Used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of a first line systemic treatment. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist. It is a member of indazoles, a member of pyridines, an aryl sulfide and a member of benzamides. it is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. it inhibits the proangiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF), thereby exerting an anti-angiogenic effect.
