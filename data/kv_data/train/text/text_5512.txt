it is an antiviral drug from viral capsid inhibitor class, manufactured by Schering-Plough and intended for the prevention of acute asthma exacerbations and common cold symptoms in asthmatic patients who have had exposure to picornavirus. It acts by inhibiting viral replication. The use of it has not gained approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to the fact that it has been found to induce CYP3A enzyme activity, therefore increasing the risk for serious drug interactions. it is a small-molecule inhibitor with activity against viruses in the picornaviridae family, including enterovirus and rhinovirus. it binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the major capsid protein and prevents uncoating of the viral RNA genome. In enteroviruses it also prevents the virus from attaching itself to the host cell.
