Trehalose, also known as alpha-D-trehalose or (GLC)2, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. Trehalose exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Trehalose has been found in human kidney, muscle and epidermis tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and urine. Trehalose exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Trehalose participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Trehalose can be converted into Beta-D-glucose and Alpha-D-glucose; which is catalyzed by the enzyme trehalase. In addition, Trehalose can be biosynthesized from trehalose 6-phosphate through its interaction with the enzyme trehalose 6-phosphate synthase. In humans, trehalose is involved in the trehalose degradation pathway. Outside of the human body, trehalose can be found in a number of food items such as salmonberry, globe artichoke, banana, and butternut squash. This makes trehalose a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
