Histidinal, also known as histidinaldehyde, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group. Histidinal is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Histidinal exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Histidinal participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Histidinal can be biosynthesized from L-histidinol through its interaction with the enzyme histidine biosynthesis trifunctional protein. In addition, Histidinal can be converted into L-histidine through its interaction with the enzyme histidine biosynthesis trifunctional protein. Outside of the human body, histidinal can be found in a number of food items such as cloudberry, burbot, other bread, and japanese persimmon. This makes histidinal a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
