it is a carbamate ester that is the ethyl ester of [(1R,3aR,4aR,6R,8aR,9S,9aS)-9-{(E)-2-[5-(3-fluorophenyl)pyridin-2-yl]ethynyl}-1-methyl-3-oxododecahydronaphtho[2,3-c]furan-6-yl]carbamic acid. A protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist used (as its sulfate salt) for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or with peripheral arterial disease. It has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and urgent coronary revascularisation. It has a role as a protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a cardiovascular drug. It is a member of pyridines, a carbamate ester, an organofluorine compound, a naphthofuran and a lactone. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+).
