it is a hydrochloride resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of tamulosin and hydrogen chloride. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and an antineoplastic agent. It contains a tamsulosin(1+). It is an enantiomer of an ent-it. it is the hydrochloride salt of tamsulosin, a sulfonamide derivative with adrenergic antagonist activity. Tamsulosin selectivity binds to and blocks the activity of alpha1 adrenoreceptors in the human prostate and bladder neck; blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck to relax, resulting in an improvement in urinary flow rate.
