it is an imidazopyridine that is 1H--imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine which is substituted at positions 1, 2, and 6 by methyl, amino, and phenyl groups, respectively. It is the most abundant of the mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked meat and fish. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent and a mutagen. It is an imidazopyridine and a primary amino compound. it is a synthetic, gray-white crystalline solid that is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide and methanol. It is produced in small quantities for research purposes. it is formed naturally during the cooking of muscle-derived foods (meat and fish). Levels of this chemical produced in this manner are dependent on cooking temperature, cooking time and method of cooking (direct or indirect). It is one of the most abundant heterocyclic amines in a typical Western diet. it has also been detected in processed food flavorings, beer, wine, and cigarette smoke. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
