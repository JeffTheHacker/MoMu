it is an odorless white to faint yellow crystalline powder. Bitter taste. A 10% solution in water has a pH of 3.5-5.0. (NTP, 1992) it is the hydrochloride salt of promethazine. It has a role as an antipruritic drug, a H1-receptor antagonist, a local anaesthetic, an antiemetic, a sedative, an anti-allergic agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It contains a promethazine(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative with antihistaminic, sedative and antiemetic properties. it selectively blocks peripheral H1 receptors thereby diminishing the effects of histamine on effector cells. it also blocks the central histaminergic receptors, thereby depressing the reticular system causing sedative and hypnotic effects. In addition, it also has centrally acting anticholinergic properties and probably mediates nausea and vomiting by acting on the medullary chemoreceptive trigger zone.
