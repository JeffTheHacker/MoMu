it is the hydrochloride salt form of mebeverine, an orally bioavailable reserpine derivative and anticholinergic agent, with spasmolytic activity. Upon administration, mebeverine targets, binds to and blocks the muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle cells in target tissues, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, uterus, gallbladder and bladder. This prevents smooth muscle contraction and relaxes smooth muscle. Additionally, this may prevent spasms, ease pain and cramps in the GI tract and improve incontinence. In addition, mebeverine stabilizes excitable membranes by decreasing the permeability of ion channels and preventing intracellular calcium accumulation. This agent also blocks noradrenaline reuptake by sympathetic nerve endings and exerts a local anesthetic effect.
