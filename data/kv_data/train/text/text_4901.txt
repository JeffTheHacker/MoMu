it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as furanones. Furanones are compounds containing a furan ring bearing a ketone group. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in onion-family vegetables. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
