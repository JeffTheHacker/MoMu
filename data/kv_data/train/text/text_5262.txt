2, 4, 6-Trimethyl-4-phenyl-1, 3-dioxane, also known as floralate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3-dioxanes. These are organic compounds containing 1, 3-dioxane, an aliphatic six-member ring with two oxygen atoms in ring positions 1 and 3. 2, 4, 6-Trimethyl-4-phenyl-1, 3-dioxane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 4, 6-trimethyl-4-phenyl-1, 3-dioxane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 4, 6-Trimethyl-4-phenyl-1, 3-dioxane has a citrus, fresh, and gardenia taste.
