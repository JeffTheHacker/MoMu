it is a steroidal aldosterone antagonist with potassium-sparing diuretic activity. it antagonizes the activity of aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor in the nephron and thereby prevents sodium reabsorption. This interferes with the sodium/potassium exchanger and causes sodium and water excretion while reducing potassium excretion.
