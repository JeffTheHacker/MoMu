it is a synthetic ten-membered oligopeptide comprising N-acetyl-3-(naphthalen-2-yl)-D-alanyl, 4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl, 3-(pyridin-3-yl)-D-alanyl, L-seryl, L-tyrosyl, N(5)-carbamoyl-D-ornithyl, L-leucyl, L-arginyl, L-prolyl, and D-alaninamide residues coupled in sequence. A gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, it is used for treatment of infertility and of hormone-sensitive cancers of the prostate and breast. It has a role as a GnRH antagonist and an antineoplastic agent. it is a synthetic decapeptide which is structurally related to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (luteinising-hormone releasing hormone).
