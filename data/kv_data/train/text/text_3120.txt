it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrahydrofurans. These are heterocyclic compounds containing a saturated, aliphatic, five-membered ring where a carbon is replaced by an oxygen. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in citrus. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
