it is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with potential antineoplastic activity. it competes with estradiol in binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), thereby inhibiting ER alpha-mediated signal transduction and gene expression. In addition, it exerts intrinsic estrogenic activity depending on the tissue. Clinical development of it has not been preceded due to its side effect profile and lack of increased efficacy over tamoxifen.
