Trifluorochloroethylene is a colorless gas with a faint ethereal odor. It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its vapor pressure. It is very toxic by inhalation and is easily ignited. The vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily. This leak can either be a liquid or vapor leak. The vapors can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. Under prolonged exposure to intense heat or fire the containers may violently rupture and rocket, or the material may polymerize with possible container rupture.
