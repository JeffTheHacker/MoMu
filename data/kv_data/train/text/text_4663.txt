2-Hydroxy-2, 6, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone, also known as 2, 6, 6-trimethyl-2-hydroxycyclohexanone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyloins. These are organic compounds containing an alpha hydroxy ketone. Acyloins are formally derived from reductive coupling of carboxylic acyl groups. 2-Hydroxy-2, 6, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-hydroxy-2, 6, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 2-Hydroxy-2, 6, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone is a sweet, herbal, and tobacco tasting compound that can be found in tea.
