it is a (6E)-7-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(propan-2-yl)-1H-indol-2-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid diastereoisomer in which the stereocentres beta- and delta- to the carboxy group have R and S configuration, respectively. The drug it is an equimolar mixture of this compound and its enantiomer. It is a (6E)-7-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(propan-2-yl)-1H-indol-2-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid and a statin (synthetic). It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). It is an enantiomer of a (3S,5R)-it. it is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic properties. it competitively inhibits hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses through the suppression of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects mediated by alterations of lipid metabolism, it may possess chemopreventive and therapeutic antineoplastic properties.
