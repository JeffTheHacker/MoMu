6-Decanolide, also known as 6-butylhexanolide or e-decalactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lactones. These are cyclic esters of hydroxy carboxylic acids, containing a 1-oxacycloalkan-2-one structure, or analogues having unsaturation or heteroatoms replacing one or more carbon atoms of the ring. 6-Decanolide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 6-decanolide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 6-Decanolide has a sweet, creamy, and tonka taste.
