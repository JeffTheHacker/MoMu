Romidepsin is an intravenously administered histone deacetylase inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is approved for use in refractory or relapsed cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphomas. Romidepsin is associated with modest rate of minor serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury, although it has been reported to cause reactivation of hepatitis B. Romidepsin is a bicyclic depsipeptide antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum with antineoplastic activity. After intracellular activation, romidepsin binds to and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), resulting in alterations in gene expression and the induction of cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. This agent also inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and depletes several heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-dependent oncoproteins.
