it, also known as Î³-taraxasterol or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Gamma-taraxasterol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Gamma-taraxasterol can be found in a number of food items such as tea, alcoholic beverages, burdock, and soy bean. This makes Gamma-taraxasterol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
