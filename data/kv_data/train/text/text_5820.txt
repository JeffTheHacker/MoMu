it is a pyrazolodiazepinone derivative used as an anaesthetic in veterinary medicine. it is typically used in combination with the NMDA antagonist tiletamine or the Î±2 adrenoceptor agonist xylazine. It is around four times the potency of diazepam but it is both water-soluble and un-ionized at physiological pH meaning that its onset is very fast.
