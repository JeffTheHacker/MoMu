it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 5, 10-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids. These are aromadendrane sesquiterpenoids that arise from the C5-C10 cyclization of the aromadendrane skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, spathulenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is an earthy, fruity, and herbal tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as tarragon, hyssop, white cabbage, and common oregano. This makes spathulenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
