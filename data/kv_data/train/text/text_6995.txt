N-Acetyl-2, 6-diethylaniline, also known as N-(2, 6-diethylphenyl)-acetamide or 2', 6'-diethyl-acetanilide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetanilides. These are organic compounds containing an acetamide group conjugated to a phenyl group. N-Acetyl-2, 6-diethylaniline exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, N-acetyl-2, 6-diethylaniline is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
