it is a succinate salt obtained by reaction of sumatriptan with one equivalent of succinic acid. Selective agonist for a vascular 5-HT1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT1D family). Used for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist and a vasoconstrictor agent. It contains a sumatriptan(1+). it is the succinate salt form of sumatriptan, a member of the triptan class of compounds with anti-migraine property. it selectively binds to and activates serotonin 5-HT1 receptors. This results in constriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial blood vessels via stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptors, thereby reducing the vascular pulsation and may provide relief in migraine headaches. Furthermore, agonistic action of this agent through presynaptic stimulation of 5-HT1D and/or 5-HT1F receptors prevents release of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory neuropeptide (calcitonin gene-related peptide), thereby may also relieve migraine headaches. In addition, central inhibition of pain transmission via the inhibition of trigeminal neurons in the brain stems and upper spinal cord mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT 1F receptors also aides in the alleviation of migraine pain.
