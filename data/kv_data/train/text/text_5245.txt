4, 11-Dichloro-5, 12-dihydroquino[2, 3-b]acridine-7, 14-dione, also known as 4, 11-dichloro quinacridone or 4, 11 dcqa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridoacridines. Pyridoacridines are compounds containing a pyridoacridine ring system, which consists of a pyridine fused to an acridine. 4, 11-Dichloro-5, 12-dihydroquino[2, 3-b]acridine-7, 14-dione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4, 11-dichloro-5, 12-dihydroquino[2, 3-b]acridine-7, 14-dione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
