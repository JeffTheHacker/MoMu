it is the decanoate ester of haloperidol, a phenylbutylpiperadine derivative with antipsychotic, neuroleptic and antiemetic effects. Haloperidol competitively blocks postsynaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the mesolimbic system of the brain leading to anti-delusionary and anti-hallucinogenic effects. The antagonistic activity mediated through D2 dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) account for its antiemetic activity.
