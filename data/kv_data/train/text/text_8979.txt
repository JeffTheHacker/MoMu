it is a monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid substituted at position 2 by a 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-benzoxazol-5-yl group (the S-enantiomer). Although it was shown to be effective in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the clinical use of it was discontinued due to possible hepatotoxic side-effects. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a hepatotoxic agent, a protein kinase C agonist and an antirheumatic drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a member of 1,3-benzoxazoles and an organofluorine compound. It derives from a propionic acid.
