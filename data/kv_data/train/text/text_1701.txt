it is an aminonucleoside antibiotic, derived from the Streptomyces alboniger bacterium, that causes premature chain termination during translation taking place in the ribosome. It has a role as a nucleoside antibiotic, an antiinfective agent, an antineoplastic agent, a protein synthesis inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent, an EC 3.4.11.14 (cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase) inhibitor and an EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl-peptidase II) inhibitor. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces alboniger. Acting as an analog of the 3' terminal end of aminoacyl-tRNA, it incorporates itself into a growing polypeptide chain and causes its premature termination, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. This agent has antimicrobial, antitrypanosomal, and antineoplastic properties; it is used as an antibiotic in cell culture. (NCI04)
