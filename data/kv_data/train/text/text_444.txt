Galactinol, also known as 6 beta-galactinol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. Galactinol is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Galactinol exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Galactinol can be biosynthesized from D-galactose and myoinositol through its interaction with the enzyme Alpha-galactosidase a. In humans, galactinol is involved in the galactose metabolism pathway. Galactinol is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the galactosemia pathway.
