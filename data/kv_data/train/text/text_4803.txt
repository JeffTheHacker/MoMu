it is a member of the class of 1-benzofurans that is 3-bromo-1-benzofuran which is substituted by a 2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl group at position 2 and by a (2-butyl-5-carboxy-4-chloro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl group at position 5. It is an angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist and was in clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension (now discontinued). It has a role as an angiotensin receptor antagonist and an antihypertensive agent. It is a member of tetrazoles, an imidazolyl carboxylic acid, a member of 1-benzofurans, an organochlorine compound, an organobromine compound, a monocarboxylic acid and a biaryl. It is a conjugate acid of a it(2-). it is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive activity. it selectively competes with angiotensin II for the binding of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor subtype 1 in vascular smooth muscle, thereby blocking angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction resulting in vascular dilatation. In addition, the antagonistic effect on AT1 in the adrenal gland, prevents angiotensin II-induced stimulation of aldosterone synthesis and secretion by the adrenal cortex. This blocks the effects of aldosterone leading to an increase in sodium excretion and water and eventually a reduction in plasma volume and blood pressure.
