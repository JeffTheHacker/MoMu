it is a dimeric, non-ionic, water-soluble, radiographic contrast agent, used particularly in coronary angiography. It has a role as a radioopaque medium. it is a dimeric iso-osmolar, non-ionic, hydrophilic iodinated radiocontrast agent used in diagnostic imaging. Upon intravascular administration and during computed tomography (CT) imaging, it blocks x-rays and appears opaque on x-ray images. This allows body structures that absorb iodine to be visualized. The degree of opacity produced by it is directly proportional to the total amount of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. The visualization of body structures is dependent upon the distribution and elimination of it. Compared to other iodinated contrast agents, it appears to exhibit less nephrotoxicity.
