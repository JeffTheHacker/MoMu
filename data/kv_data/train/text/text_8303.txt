4,4&#39;-sulfonyldianiline appears as odorless white or creamy white crystalline powder. Slightly bitter taste. (NTP, 1992) it is a sulfone that is diphenylsulfone in which the hydrogen atom at the 4 position of each of the phenyl groups is substituted by an amino group. It is active against a wide range of bacteria, but is mainly employed for its actions against Mycobacterium leprae, being used as part of multidrug regimens in the treatment of all forms of leprosy. It has a role as an antimalarial, a leprostatic drug, an antiinfective agent and an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a sulfone and a substituted aniline. It derives from a diphenyl sulfone. it is a synthetic derivative of diamino-sulfone with anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. As a structural analog of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), it inhibits dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme important in folate synthesis, resulting in a depletion of the folate pool and a reduction in the amount of thymidylate available for DNA synthesis. Although the exact mechanism through which it exerts its anti-inflammatory activity has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent interferes with the activation and oxidative damage of myeloperoxidase in neutrophils and inhibits the integrin-mediated adherence and chemotaxis of neutrophils. it's anti-inflammatory activities may contribute to the effects seen upon topical administration.
