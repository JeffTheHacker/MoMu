it is an acetate salt obtained by combining flecainide with one molar equivalent of acetic acid. An antiarrhythmic agent used to prevent and treat tachyarrhythmia (abnormal fast rhythm of the heart). It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It contains a flecainide(1+). it is the acetate salt form of flecainide, a synthetic agent derived from trifluoroethoxy-benzamide exhibiting antiarrhythmic and local anesthetic activity. As a class Ic antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels, flecainide depresses polarization phase 0 and decreases the induction velocity of the His-Purkinje system. It also decreases phase 4 slope and increases the depolarization threshold.
