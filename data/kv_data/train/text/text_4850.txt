(+)-cis-5, 6-Dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one belongs to the class of organic compounds known as kavalactones. These are lactones, which is structurally characterized by a benzene ring and a pyranone moiety, linked to each other to form a 4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one skeleton (+)-cis-5, 6-Dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (+)-cis-5, 6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (+)-cis-5, 6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one can be found in beverages. This makes (+)-cis-5, 6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
