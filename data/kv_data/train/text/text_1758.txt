it is an analogue of the naturally occurring tripeptide hemiasterlin, with potential antimitotic and antineoplastic activities. it binds tubulin in a similar manner as colchicine and inhibits tubulin polymerization. This results in the disruption of the cytoskeleton, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, blockage of cell division and apoptosis.
