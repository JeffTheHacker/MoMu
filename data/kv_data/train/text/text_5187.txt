it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aspidospermatan-type alkaloids. These are tryptophan-derived alkaloids that are derived from the fusion of tryptamine and a terpene unit (generally either 9 or 10 carbons). Aspidospermine and aspidospermidine (along with tabersonine) are the archetypical members of the Aspidosperma alkaloids it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
