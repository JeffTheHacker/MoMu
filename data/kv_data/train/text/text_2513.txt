it is the predominant form of mammalian vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). It is a nonapeptide containing an arginine at residue 8 and two disulfide-linked cysteines at residues of 1 and 6. It has a role as a cardiovascular drug, a hematologic agent and a mitogen. it is a synthetic peptide identical to the endogenous nonapeptide hormone with antidiuretic property. Synthesized in the hypothalamus and stored/released from the posterior lobe of the pituitary, it's primary function is regulating extracellular fluid volume. This agent can also act as a vasoconstrictor, increasing blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance.
