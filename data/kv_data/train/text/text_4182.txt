Fagopyritol a1, also known as 6 beta-galactinol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. Fagopyritol a1 is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, fagopyritol A1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, fagopyritol A1 can be found in cereals and cereal products. This makes fagopyritol A1 a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
