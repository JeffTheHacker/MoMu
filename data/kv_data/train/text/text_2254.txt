2-Isobutyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole, also known as 4, 5-dimethyl-2-isobutyloxazole or oxazole, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-isobutyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. 2-Isobutyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-isobutyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-Isobutyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole is a burnt and roasted tasting compound that can be found in potato. This makes 2-isobutyl-4, 5-dimethyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
