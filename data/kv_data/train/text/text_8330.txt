5-O-Digalloyl-3, 4-di-O-galloylquinic acid, also known as 34-g-5-digqa or 3, 4, 5, 5-tetragqa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as depsides and depsidones. These are polycyclic compounds that is either a polyphenolic compound composed of two or more monocyclic aromatic units linked by an ester bond (depside), or a compound containing the depsidone structure (depsidone). 5-O-Digalloyl-3, 4-di-O-galloylquinic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 5-O-digalloyl-3, 4-di-O-galloylquinic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
