it is the sodium salt form of fondaparinux, a synthetic glucopyranoside with antithrombotic activity. it selectively binds to antithrombin III, thereby potentiating the innate neutralization of activated factor X (Factor Xa) by antithrombin. Neutralization of Factor Xa inhibits its activity and interrupts the blood coagulation cascade, thereby preventing thrombin formation and thrombus development. (NCI05)
