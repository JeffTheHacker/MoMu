Alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-(2->6)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine is an amino trisaccharide consisting of an N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl residue attached to the galactose residue of N-acetyllactosamine via an alpha-(2->6)-linkage. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino trisaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It is a conjugate acid of an alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-(2->6)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine(1-).
