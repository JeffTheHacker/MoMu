it is a pyridinecarboxamide obtained by condensation of 4-[4-({[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]carbamoyl}amino)-3-fluorophenoxy]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid with methylamine. Used for for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who have previously received chemotherapy, anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF therapy. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a hepatotoxic agent. It is an aromatic ether, a pyridinecarboxamide, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of phenylureas. it is an orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. it binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 2 and 3, and Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases, which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. VEGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in tumor angiogenesis; the receptor tyrosine kinases RET, KIT, and PDGFR, and the serine/threonine-specific Raf kinase are involved in tumor cell signaling.
