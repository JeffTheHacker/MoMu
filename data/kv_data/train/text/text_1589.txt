3-[(2-Methyl-3-furanyl)thio]-4-heptanone, also known as 1, 3-diethylacetonyl 3-methyl-3-furyl sulfide or fema 3570, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl thioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by an aryl group. 3-[(2-Methyl-3-furanyl)thio]-4-heptanone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-[(2-methyl-3-furanyl)thio]-4-heptanone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 3-[(2-Methyl-3-furanyl)thio]-4-heptanone has a meaty and roasted taste.
