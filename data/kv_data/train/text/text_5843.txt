4, 5-Dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)thiazole, also known as 2-iso-propyl-4, 5-dimethylthiazole or 4, 5-dimethyl-2-isopropyl-thiazole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. 4, 5-Dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)thiazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)thiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)thiazole can be found in cocoa and cocoa products, nuts, and potato. This makes 4, 5-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)thiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
