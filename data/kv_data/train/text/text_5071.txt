it is a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is used to help in smoking cessation. it has been associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and, since approval and its widescale use, with rare instances of clinically apparent mild liver injury. it is a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype alpha4beta2. Nicotine stimulation of central alpha4beta2 nAChRs located at presynaptic terminals in the nucleus accumbens causes the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which may be associated with the experience of pleasure; nicotine addiction constitutes a physiologic dependence related to this dopaminergic reward system. As an AChR partial agonist, it attenuates the craving and withdrawal symptoms that occur with abstinence from nicotine but is not habit-forming itself.
