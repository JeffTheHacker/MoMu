it, also known as disulfiram or nocceler, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as p-benzoquinones. These are benzoquinones where the two C=O groups are attached at the 1- and 4-positions, respectively. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, thermophillin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, thermophillin can be found in herbs and spices and root vegetables. This makes thermophillin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
