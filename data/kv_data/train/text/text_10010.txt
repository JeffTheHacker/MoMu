Cryptotanshinone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tanshinones, isotanshinones, and derivatives. These are a group of abietane-type norditerpenoid quinones. Cryptotanshinone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, cryptotanshinone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, cryptotanshinone can be found in herbs and spices. This makes cryptotanshinone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
