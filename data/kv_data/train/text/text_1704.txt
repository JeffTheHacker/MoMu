it is a nitrosamine that is sarcosine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen has been replaced by a nitroso group. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent. It is a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative and a nitrosamine. It derives from a sarcosine. it is a pale yellow, crystalline solid nitrosamine that decomposes when exposed to light and emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition. it is used in laboratory research to induce tumors in experimental animals. This substance may be formed during the cooking of foods that contain sodium nitrite as a preservative, including meat, fish and cheese. Exposure to it irritates the skin and eyes. This substance is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
