1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is a phosphatidylcholine 32:0 in which the 1- and 2-acyl groups are specified as hexadecanoyl (palmitoyl). A synthetic phospholipid used in liposomes and lipid bilayers to study biological membranes. It is also a major constituent of pulmonary surfactants. It has a role as a surfactant and a mouse metabolite. It is a phosphatidylcholine 32:0 and a 1-acyl-2-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid. it is a lung surfactant agent that is used as a replacement for endogenous lung surfactant. it is effective in reducing the surface tension of pulmonary fluids, thereby increasing lung compliance properties to prevent alveolar collapse and improve breathing. This drug is used in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress.
