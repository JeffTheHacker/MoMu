it is a potassium ion exchange resin composed of benzene-diethyl polymer with ethenyl-benzene, sulfonated, sodium salt. Administered as an oral suspension, sodium it lowers serum potassium levels by exchanging its sodium ions for potassium ions. Acting primarily in the large intestine, this agent also exchanges its sodium ions for calcium and magnesium ions, resulting in a decrease in serum calcium and magnesium levels. (NCI04)
