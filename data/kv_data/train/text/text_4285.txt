it is a secoiridoid glycoside that is the methyl ester of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-5-carboxylic acid which is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 4 by hydroxy, ethylidene, and carboxymethyl groups, respectively and in which the anomeric hydroxy group at position 2 has been converted into its beta-D-glucoside and the carboxylic acid moiety of the carboxymethyl substituent has been converted to the corresponding 4-hydroxyphenethyl ester (the 2S,3E,4S stereoisomer). An important phenolic compound present in olive cultivars. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a secoiridoid glycoside, a methyl ester, a diester, a member of pyrans, a member of phenols and a beta-D-glucoside.
