1, 2, 4-Tris(methylene)cyclohexane, also known as tripropylphosphine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched unsaturated hydrocarbons. These are hydrocarbons that contains one or more unsaturated carbon atoms, and an aliphatic branch. 1, 2, 4-Tris(methylene)cyclohexane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 2, 4-tris(methylene)cyclohexane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 4-tris(methylene)cyclohexane can be found in fruits. This makes 1, 2, 4-tris(methylene)cyclohexane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
