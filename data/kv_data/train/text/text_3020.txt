it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aristolane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the aristolane skeleton. Aristolanes arise from the C6, C11 cyclization of the bicyclic eremophilane skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices and root vegetables. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
