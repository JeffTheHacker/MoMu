it is an organic sodium salt of prednisolone phosphate. It is an ophthalmology drug used for the treatment of short-term inflammatory eye conditions and helps relieve inflammation, redness and irritation of the eyes. It has a role as an ophthalmology drug, an anti-inflammatory agent, a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, a prodrug and an anti-allergic agent. It is an organic sodium salt and a glucocorticoid. It contains a prednisolone phosphate(2-). Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate is the sodium phosphate salt form of prednisolone, a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. As a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, prednisolone sodium phosphate binds to specific intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, and causes the ligand- receptor complex to be translocated to the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes such as various cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent mediators of inflammation. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations.
