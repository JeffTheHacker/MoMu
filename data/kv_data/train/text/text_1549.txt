Sugiol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Sugiol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, sugiol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, sugiol can be found in fruits. This makes sugiol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
