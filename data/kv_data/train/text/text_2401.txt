it, also known as kytril or sancuso, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indazole-3-carboxamides. These are aromatic compounds containing an indazole ring system that is substituted at the 3-position with a carboxamide group. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, granisetron is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it is an indazole derivative with antiemetic properties. As a selective serotonin receptor antagonist, granisetron competitively blocks the action of serotonin at 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors, resulting in the suppression of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
