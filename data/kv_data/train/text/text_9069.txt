it, also known as fema 3244, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, trimethylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a cocoa, earthy, and hazelnut tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as coffee and coffee products, green vegetables, cereals and cereal products, and pulses. This makes trimethylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
