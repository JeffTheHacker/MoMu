1, 2-Dehydrosalsolinol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydroisoquinolines. These are isoquinoline derivatives where exactly two carbon atoms joined by an aromatic bond are linked with a hydrogen atom each, resulting in a CC single bond. 1, 2-Dehydrosalsolinol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
