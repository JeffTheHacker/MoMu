it is a tertiary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2S)-1-(4-cyanopyridin-2-yl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid with the secondary amino group of (2S)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-2-[(5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)amino]acetamide. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 1.1.1.42 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes, a cyanopyridine, a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, an organofluorine compound, a tertiary carboxamide and a secondary carboxamide. it is an orally available inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, AG-120 specifically inhibits a mutated form of IDH1 in the cytoplasm, which inhibits the formation of the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). This may lead to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in IDH1-expressing tumor cells. IDH1, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle, is mutated in a variety of cancers; it initiates and drives cancer growth by both blocking cell differentiation and catalyzing the formation of 2HG.
