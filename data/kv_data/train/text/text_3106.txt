2-Methylacetoacetyl-CoA, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-oxo-acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a 3-oxo acylated coenzyme A derivative. 2-Methylacetoacetyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 2-Methylacetoacetyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. 2-Methylacetoacetyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, the isovaleric acidemia pathway, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, and Beta-ketothiolase deficiency.
