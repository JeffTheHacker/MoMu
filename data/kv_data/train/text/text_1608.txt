4-Aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the beta carbon atom. 4-Aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). 4-Aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 4-aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
