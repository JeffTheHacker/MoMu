it is an oligopeptide comprising pyroglutamyl, histidyl, tryptophyl, seryl, tyrosyl, D-leucyl, leucyl, arginyl, and N-ethylprolinamide residues joined in sequence. It is a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and is used as a subcutaneous hydrogel implant (particularly as the acetate salt) for the treatment of prostate cancer and for the suppression of gonadal sex hormone production in children with central precocious puberty. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist and an anti-estrogen. it is a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. it binds to and activates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Continuous, prolonged administration of it in males results in pituitary GnRH receptor desensitization and inhibition of pituitary secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to a significant decline in testosterone production; in females, prolonged administration results in a decrease in estradiol production. This agent reduces testosterone production to castration levels and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression.
