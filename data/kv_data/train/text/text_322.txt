it is an organic sodium salt. It contains a itcillin(2-). itcillin Disodium is the disodium salt form of itcillin, a broad-spectrum, semi-synthetic penicillin antibiotic with bactericidal and beta-lactamase resistant activity. Similar to carbenicillin in action, itcillin inactivates the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation prevents the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan strands, thereby inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. This leads to incomplete bacterial cell wall synthesis and eventually causes cell lysis.
