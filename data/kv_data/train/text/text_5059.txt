it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ginkgolides and bilobalides. These are diterpene lactones with a structure based either on the gingkolide or the bilobalide skeleton. The ginkgolide skeleton is a very rigid structure consisting of hexacyclic C20 trilactone. The cis-fused F/A/D/C ring junction forms an empty semi-ball hole, the D ring contains a cage form tetrahydrofuran ring which occupies the center of the empty hole, and the oxygen atoms of the D, C and F ring and 10-hydroxyl group consist of an analogous crown ether structure. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, ginkgolide J is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, ginkgolide J can be found in fats and oils and ginkgo nuts. This makes ginkgolide J a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
