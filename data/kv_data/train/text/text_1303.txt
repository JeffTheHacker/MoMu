it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT03933761 (it in Fusion Positive, Reversion Negative High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer or Carcinosarcoma With BRCA1/2 Gene Mutations If Progression on Substrate Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase Inhibitbor (PARPI) or Chemotherapy). it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it selectively binds to PARP and prevents PARP-mediated repair of single-strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability, and eventually leads to apoptosis. PARP is activated by single-strand DNA breaks and, subsequently, catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins which then transduce signals to recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA. it may both potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell chemo- and radioresistance.
