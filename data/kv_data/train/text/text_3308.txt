it is a mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide compound having a hexacosanoyl group amide-linked to a C18 sphinganine base, with no hydroxylation at C-4 of the long-chain base or on the C26 very-long-chain fatty acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from an Ins-1-P-Cer(d18:0/26:0).
