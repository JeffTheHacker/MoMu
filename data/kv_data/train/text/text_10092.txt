Amarogentin is a secoiridoid glycoside that consists of (4aS,5R,6R)-5-ethenyl-6-hydroxy-4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H,3H-pyrano[3,4-c]pyran-1-one having a 2-O-[(3,3',5-trihydroxybiphenyl-2-yl)carbonyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl group attached at position 6 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor and a metabolite. It is a secoiridoid glycoside and a monosaccharide derivative.
