it is the phosphate salt of antazoline, an ethylenediamine derivative with histamine H1 antagonistic and sedative properties. Antazoline antagonizes histamine H1 receptor and prevents the typical allergic symptoms caused by histamine activities on capillaries, skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal and bronchial smooth muscles. These histamine activities include vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, pain, itching, and spasmodic contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscles. Antazoline is used to provide symptomatic relieve of allergic symptoms.
