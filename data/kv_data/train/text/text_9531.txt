it is a tocopherol in which the chroman-6-ol core is substituted by methyl groups at positions 7 and 8. It is found particularly in maize (corn) oil and soya bean (soybean) oils. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a food antioxidant, a food component and an algal metabolite. it is the orally bioavailable gamma form of the naturally-occurring fat-soluble vitamin E, found in certain nuts and seeds, with potential antioxidant activity.
