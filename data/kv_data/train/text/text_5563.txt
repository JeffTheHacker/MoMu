Barogenin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydroxy bile acids, alcohols and derivatives. Dihydroxy bile acids, alcohols and derivatives are compounds containing or derived from a bile acid or alcohol, and which bears exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Barogenin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Barogenin has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, barogenin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, barogenin can be found in alcoholic beverages and potato. This makes barogenin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
