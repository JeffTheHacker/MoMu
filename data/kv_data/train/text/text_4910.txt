it (anhydrous) is a racemate composed of equimolar amounts of dextroit and levoit. The monohydrate form is commonly used as a local anaesthetic. It has a role as an adrenergic antagonist, an amphiphile, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.6.3.8 (Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor and a local anaesthetic. It contains a levoit (anhydrous), a dextroit (anhydrous) and a bupivacaine(1+). Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is a long-acting, amide-type local anesthetic. Bupivicaine reversibly binds to specific sodium ion channels in the neuronal membrane, resulting in a decrease in the voltage-dependent membrane permeability to sodium ions and membrane stabilization; inhibition of depolarization and nerve impulse conduction; and a reversible loss of sensation.
