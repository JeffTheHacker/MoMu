it, also known as estradiol-17 beta-glucuronide or e(2)17g CPD, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal glycosides. These are sterol lipids containing a carbohydrate moiety glycosidically linked to the steroid skeleton. Thus, it is considered to be a steroid conjugate lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human hepatic tissue, liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
