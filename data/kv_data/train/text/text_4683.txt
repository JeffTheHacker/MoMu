it is the hydrochloride salt of butenafine. An inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, an enzyme responsible for the creation of sterols needed in fungal cell membranes, it is used for treatment of dermatological fungal infections. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.132 (squalene monooxygenase) inhibitor and an antifungal drug. It is a hydrochloride and an ammonium salt. It contains a butenafine. it is the hydrochloride salt form of butenafine, a synthetic benzylamine derivative with fungicidal properties. it interferes with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an important component of fungal cell membranes, by inhibiting the epoxidation of squalene. This alters fungal membrane permeability and causes growth inhibition. it is active against a number of dermatophytes, including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Sporothrix schenckii, and yeasts, including Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis.
