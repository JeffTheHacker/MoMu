it is a 20-oxo steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a chlorinated steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It has a role as an androgen antagonist. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane. it is a synthetic steroidal anti-androgen with antineoplastic activity. it, in its acetate form, binds the androgen receptor (AR), thereby preventing androgen-induced receptor activation and inhibiting the growth of testosterone-sensitive tumor cells. This agent also exerts progesterogenic activity, resulting in a reduction in testicular androgen secretion and total androgen blockade. (NCI04)
