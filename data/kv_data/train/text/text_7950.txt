it is a piperidine that is 3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidine carrying additional 2-cyanobenzyl and 3-aminopiperidin-1-yl groups at positions 1 and 2 respectively (the R-enantiomer). Used in the form of its benzoate salt for treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has a role as an EC 3.4.14.5 (dipeptidyl-peptidase IV) inhibitor and a hypoglycemic agent. It is a nitrile, a member of piperidines, a member of pyrimidines and a primary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a selective, orally bioavailable, pyrimidinedione-based inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), with hypoglycemic activity. In addition to its effect on glucose levels, it may inhibit inflammatory responses by preventing the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-mediated formation of proinflammatory cytokines.
