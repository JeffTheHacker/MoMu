it is a neprilysn (NEP) inhibitor prodrug with natriuretic activity. Upon administration, it is metabolized by esterases to its active metabolite, itat, which inhibits NEP, a neutral endopeptidase that cleaves natriuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and c-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), as well as certain vasoconstricting peptides including as angiotensin I and II, and endothelin-1. Additionally, itat may inhibit NEP-mediated catabolism of certain peptide-based agents, thereby improving their in vivo stability and increasing tumor cell exposure.
