it appears as a white crystalline solid. Insoluble in water. Combustible, although difficult to ignite. Toxic by inhalation (dust, etc.). Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. it is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of 1-naphthol with methylcarbamic acid. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a carbamate insecticide, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide, an agrochemical and a plant growth retardant. It is a carbamate ester and a member of naphthalenes. It derives from a methylcarbamic acid and a 1-naphthol. it is a synthetic carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and suspected endocrine disruptor that is used as a pesticide. It is characterized as a toxic, white-grey odorless solid, and exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
