it is a synthetic derivative of inosinic acid with antiretroviral and immunomodulatory properties. it acts through a number of pathways to stimulate intracellular antiviral activity of the immune system: it stimulates interferon production; activates the oligoadenylate synthase-RNase L pathway; stimulates natural killer cell activity; and acts as a non-mitogenic stimulator of the immune system. This agent also inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. (NCI04)
