5alpha-it, also known as 3-keto-5alpha, 16-androstene or androstenone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as androgens and derivatives. These are 3-hydroxylated C19 steroid hormones. They are known to favor the development of masculine characteristics. They also show profound effects on scalp and body hair in humans. 5alpha-it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. 5alpha-it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 5alpha-androst-16-en-3-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 5alpha-androst-16-en-3-one can be found in parsnip and wild celery. This makes 5alpha-androst-16-en-3-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
