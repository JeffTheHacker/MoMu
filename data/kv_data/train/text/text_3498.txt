it is the cyclic ketal obtained by formal condensation of 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethanone with pentane-1,2-diol. A triazole fungicide, it is used commercially as a diastereoisomeric mixture on soft fruit (including apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums and prunes), nuts (including peanuts, pecans and almonds), mushrooms, and grasses grown for seeds. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of triazoles, a cyclic ketal, a dichlorobenzene, a conazole fungicide and a triazole fungicide.
