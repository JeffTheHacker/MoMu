it, also known as it or fema 3854, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkylthiols. These are organic compounds containing the thiol functional group linked to an alkyl chain. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-mercapto-3-methyl-1-butanol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a sweet, meat broth, and roasted tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, coffee and coffee products, and fruits. This makes 3-mercapto-3-methyl-1-butanol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
