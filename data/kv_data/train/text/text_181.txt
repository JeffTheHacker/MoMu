it is the simplest (and the only achiral) proteinogenic amino acid, with a hydrogen atom as its side chain. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a hepatoprotective agent, an EC 2.1.2.1 (it hydroxymethyltransferase) inhibitor, a NMDA receptor agonist, a micronutrient, a fundamental metabolite and a neurotransmitter. It is an alpha-amino acid, a serine family amino acid and a proteinogenic amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a glycinium. It is a conjugate acid of a glycinate. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a non-essential, non-polar, non-optical, glucogenic amino acid. it, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, triggers chloride ion influx via ionotropic receptors, thereby creating an inhibitory post-synaptic potential. In contrast, this agent also acts as a co-agonist, along with glutamate, facilitating an excitatory potential at the glutaminergic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. it is an important component and precursor for many macromolecules in the cells.
