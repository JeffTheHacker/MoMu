it is a xanthophyll that is beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 6 have been acylated by an all-trans-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosa-2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,22-decaenoyl group and a 12-methyltetradecanoyl group, respectively. it is responsible for the characteristic yellow-golden colour which gives the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus its name. It has a role as an antioxidant, a biological pigment, a virulence factor and a metabolite. It is a xanthophyll, a D-aldohexose derivative, a triol, a fatty acid ester and an apo carotenoid triterpenoid. It derives from a beta-D-glucose and a 12-methyltetradecanoic acid.
