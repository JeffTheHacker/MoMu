6alpha-it is the 6alpha-stereoisomer of 6-it. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug, a neuroprotective agent, an antiemetic, an adrenergic agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a 6-it, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. it is a synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations.
