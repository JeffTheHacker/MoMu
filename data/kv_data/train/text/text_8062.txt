it is a member of the class of pyridines that is pyridine which is substituted at positions 2 and 5 by o-(tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl and (3,5-dibutyl-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl groups, respectively. It is a nonpeptide antagonist of angiotensin II, type 1 (AT1) receptors, used for the treatment of hypertension. It has a role as an angiotensin receptor antagonist and an antihypertensive agent. It is a member of tetrazoles, a member of pyridines, a member of triazoles and a member of benzenes. it is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive activity. it selectively competes with angiotensin II for the binding of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor subtype 1 in vascular smooth muscle, thereby blocking angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction resulting in vascular dilatation. In addition, the antagonistic effect on AT1 in the adrenal gland, prevents angiotensin II-induced stimulation of aldosterone synthesis and secretion by the adrenal cortex. This blocks the effects of aldosterone leading to an increase in sodium excretion and water and eventually a reduction in plasma volume and blood pressure.
