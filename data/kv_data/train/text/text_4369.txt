it is an amino acid amide in which N-propyl-DL-alanine and 2-methylaniline have combined to form the amide bond; used as a local anaesthetic. It has a role as a local anaesthetic and an anticonvulsant. It is an amino acid amide and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a toluidine derivative and intermediate-acting amino amide with local anesthetic property. it stabilizes the neuronal membrane by preferential binding to and inhibiting depolarization of the voltage-gated sodium channel. This results in a decrease in membrane permeability and subsequent inhibition of the ionic sodium influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses.
