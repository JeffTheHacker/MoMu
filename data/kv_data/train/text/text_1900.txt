it is the ester obtained by formal condensation of 4-butylaminobenzoic acid with nonaethylene glycol monomethyl ether. Structurally related to procaine and benzocaine, it has an anaesthetic effect on the stretch sensors in the lungs, and is used as a non-narcotic cough suppressant. It has a role as an antitussive and an anaesthetic. It is a benzoate ester, a substituted aniline and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a 4-(butylamino)benzoic acid and a nonaethylene glycol monomethyl ether. it is a synthetic butylamino-benzoate derivative related to tetracaine and a peripherally acting antitussive, nonnarcotic it reduces the cough reflex by anesthetizing and depressing mechanoreceptors in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura. It is recommended for cough relief in the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, and for chronic cough such as in asthma. (NCI04)
