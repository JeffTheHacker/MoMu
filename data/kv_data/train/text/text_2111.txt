2, 3, 4, 5-Tetrahydroxybenzoic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ubiquinols. These are coenzyme Q derivatives containing a 5, 6-dimethoxy-3-methylbenzene-1, 4-diol moiety to which an isoprenyl group is attached at ring position 2(or 6). 2, 3, 4, 5-Tetrahydroxybenzoic acid is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3, 4, 5-tetrahydroxybenzoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
