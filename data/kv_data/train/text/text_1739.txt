Quinupristin and dalfopristin are intravenously administered, streptogramin antibiotics used in fixed combination to treat severe bacterial infections due to susceptible organisms including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The fixed combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin is associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been convincingly linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Dalfopristin is a semi-synthetic derivative of streptogramin A produced by streptomycetes. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome by binding to the 70S subunit, and also alters the configuration of the ribosome to make it more susceptible for streptogramin B binding. Dalfopristin is used in combination with quinopristin, a streptogramin B derivative. This combination is active against most gram-positive organisms, including Enterococcus faecium, and is also active against some gram-negative organisms and mycoplasma.
