Sodium Lactate, D- is the sodium salt of the dextro isomer of lactic acid with alkalinizing and electrolyte replenishing property. Upon metabolism, sodium lactate D is converted to bicarbonate, thereby increasing plasma bicarbonate, which facilitates removal of hydrogen ion and lactate from blood stream and leads to raised blood pH.
