Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that is used as treatment and prevention of travelersâ diarrhea and, in higher doses, for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with advanced liver disease and to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Rifaximin has minimal oral absorption and has not been implicated in causing liver test abnormalities or clinically apparent liver injury. Rifaximin is an orally administered, semi-synthetic, nonsystemic antibiotic derived from rifamycin SV with antibacterial activity. Rifaximin binds to the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibiting bacterial RNA synthesis and bacterial cell growth. As rifaximin is not well absorbed, its antibacterial activity is largely localized to the gastrointestinal tract.
