(Â±)-it, also known as 4-methylene-L-proline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as proline and derivatives. Proline and derivatives are compounds containing proline or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of proline at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom (Â±)-it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (Â±)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (Â±)-it can be found in fruits. This makes (Â±)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
