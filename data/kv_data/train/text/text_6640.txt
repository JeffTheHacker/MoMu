Xi-2-methyl-1, 3-oxathiane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxathianes. Oxathianes are compounds containing an oxathiane moiety, which consists of a saturated aliphatic six-member ring with one oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and four carbon atoms. Isomers of oxaphospholane include 1, 2-oxathiane, 1, 3-oxathiane, and 1, 4-oxathiane. Xi-2-methyl-1, 3-oxathiane is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, xi-2-methyl-1, 3-oxathiane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xi-2-methyl-1, 3-oxathiane can be found in onion-family vegetables. This makes xi-2-methyl-1, 3-oxathiane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
