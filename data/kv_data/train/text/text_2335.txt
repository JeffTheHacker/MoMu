it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Neoplasm, Solid Tumor, COLON CANCER, BREAST CANCER, and Advanced Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of certain class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms and mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) in the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits both certain PI3K isoforms and mTOR in an ATP-competitive manner which may inhibit both the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway in and proliferation of tumor cells overexpressing PI3K and/or mTOR. The PI3K/mTOR pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumor cells and plays a key role in promoting cancer cell proliferation, and survival, motility and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase downstream of PI3K, may also be activated in a PI3K-independent fashion; therefore, this agent may be more potent than an agent that inhibits either PI3K or mTOR alone. In addition, it may inhibit DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), thereby inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks.
