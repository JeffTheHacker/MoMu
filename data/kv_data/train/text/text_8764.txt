N-(5-{[(5-tert-butyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)methyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of piperidine-4-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 5-{[(5-tert-butyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)methyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-amine. It is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9 kinases and exhibits anti-cancer properties. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor and an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is a piperidinecarboxamide, a member of 1,3-oxazoles, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an organic sulfide and a secondary carboxamide.
