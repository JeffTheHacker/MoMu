Aspartic acid is an alpha-amino acid that consists of succinic acid bearing a single alpha-amino substituent It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is an alpha-amino acid, a C4-dicarboxylic acid and a polar amino acid. It contains a carboxymethyl group. It is a conjugate acid of an aspartate(1-) and an aspartate. Aspartic Acid is a non-essential amino acid in humans, Aspartic Acid has an overall negative charge and plays an important role in the synthesis of other amino acids and in the citric acid and urea cycles. Asparagine, arginine, lysine, methionine, isoleucine, and some nucleotides are synthesized from aspartic acid. Aspartic acid also serves as a neurotransmitter. (NCI04)
