it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside compound having 5-trifluoromethyluracil as the nucleobase. An antiviral drug used mainly in the treatment of primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis. It has a role as an antiviral drug, an antimetabolite, an EC 2.1.1.45 (thymidylate synthase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a nucleoside analogue, an organofluorine compound and a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside. it is a fluorinated thymidine analog with potential antineoplastic activity. it is incorporated into DNA and inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis, inhibition of protein synthesis, and apoptosis. This agent also exhibits antiviral activity. (NCI04)
