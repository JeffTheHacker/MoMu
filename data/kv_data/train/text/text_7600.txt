3-Acetoxyscirpene-4, 15-diol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trichothecenes. These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzopyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetyl, or other substituents. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12, 13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain. 3-Acetoxyscirpene-4, 15-diol is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-acetoxyscirpene-4, 15-diol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 3-Acetoxyscirpene-4, 15-diol is a potentially toxic compound.
