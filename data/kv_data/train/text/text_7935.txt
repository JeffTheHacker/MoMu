Src Inhibitor-1 is a member of the class of quinazolines that is quinazoline which is substituted at position 4 by a p-phenoxyanilino group and at positions 6 and 7 by methoxy groups. It is a potent, competitive dual site (both the ATP- and peptide-binding) Src kinase inhibitor. Src Inhibitor-1 is one of the 'gold standards' for Src kinase inhibition that has been shown to use PP1 or PP2 in parallel with Src-I1 to inhbit Src family kinases. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.2 (non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of quinazolines, a secondary amino compound, an aromatic ether and a polyether.
