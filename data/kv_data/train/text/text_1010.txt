It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is one of nine essential amino acids in humans (present in dietary proteins), it has diverse physiological functions, such as assisting wound healing, detoxification of nitrogenous wastes, stimulating immune function, and promoting secretion of several hormones.
