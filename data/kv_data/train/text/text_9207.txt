Halobetasol propionate, also known as halobetasol or ultravate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gluco/mineralocorticoids, progestogins and derivatives. These are steroids with a structure based on a hydroxylated prostane moiety. Halobetasol propionate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Halobetasol propionate has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, halobetasol propionate is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Halobetasol Propionate is the propionate salt form of halobetasol, a synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictor activities. Halobetasol, a topical steroid, diffuses across cell membranes to interact with cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors located in both the dermal and intradermal cells, thereby activating gene expression of anti-inflammatory proteins mediated via corticosteroid receptor response element. Specifically, this agent induces phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, which inhibit the release of arachidonic acid, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. As a result, halobetasol reduces edema, erythema, and pruritus through its cutaneous effects on vascular dilation and permeability.
