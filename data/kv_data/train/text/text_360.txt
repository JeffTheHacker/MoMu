Kaempferol-3-rutinoside is a kaempferol O-glucoside that is kaempferol attached to a rutinosyl [6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucosyl] residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the leaves of Solanum campaniforme. It has a role as a metabolite, a radical scavenger and a plant metabolite. It is a rutinoside, a trihydroxyflavone, a disaccharide derivative and a kaempferol O-glucoside.
