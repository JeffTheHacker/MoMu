Sec-butyl methoxypyrazine, also known as it or fema 3433, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxypyrazines. These are pyrazines containing a methoxyl group attached to the pyrazine ring. Sec-butyl methoxypyrazine is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, sec-butyl methoxypyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Sec-butyl methoxypyrazine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Sec-butyl methoxypyrazine is a bell, carrot, and earth tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as orange bell pepper, alcoholic beverages, green bell pepper, and wild carrot. This makes sec-butyl methoxypyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
