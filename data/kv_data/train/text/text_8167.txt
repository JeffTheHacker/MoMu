5'-Phosphoribosyl-a-N-formylglycineamidine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pentose phosphates. These are carbohydrate derivatives containing a pentose substituted by one or more phosphate groups. 5'-Phosphoribosyl-a-N-formylglycineamidine is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). 5'-Phosphoribosyl-a-N-formylglycineamidine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. 5'-Phosphoribosyl-a-N-formylglycineamidine and tetrahydrofolic acid can be converted into glycineamideribotide and 5, 10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase 2.
