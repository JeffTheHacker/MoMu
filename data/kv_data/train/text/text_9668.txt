it is an oral nucleoside analogue and potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase that is used in combination with other antiviral agents to treat chronic hepatitis C. Elevations in serum enzyme levels during it therapy are uncommon, and it has not been implicated convincingly in cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. Nevertheless, and for unknown reasons, successful antiviral therapy of hepatitis C with it and other direct acting agents in patients with cirrhosis is occasionally complicated by hepatic decompensation; furthermore, treatment can cause reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients coinfected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). it is an orally available nucleotide prodrug and a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitor with potential HCV inhibiting activity. Upon oral administration, it is metabolized to 2'-deoxy-2'-alpha-fluoro-beta-C-methyluridine-5'-monophosphate, which is then converted into the active triphosphate nucleotide that inhibits the NS5B polymerase, thereby preventing viral replication. The HCV NS5B protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the replication of the viral HCV RNA genome.
