it is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of 3-hydroxypropanoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). A major component of the dauer pheromone of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it synergises with ascr#2 and ascr#3 as a population-density signal to promote entry into an alternate larval stage, the nonfeeding and highly persistent dauer diapause. It has a role as a pheromone and a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a 3-hydroxypropionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-).
