it is an odorless white to yellowish crystalline powder. Slightly bitter taste. Acid to litmus. (NTP, 1992) it is a sulfonamide antibacterial with an oxazole substituent. It has antibiotic activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and a drug allergen. It is a member of isoxazoles, a sulfonamide and a sulfonamide antibiotic. It derives from a sulfanilamide. it is a broad-spectrum, short-acting sulfanilamide and a synthetic analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) with antibacterial property. it competes with PABA for the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, thereby preventing the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid, the immediate precursor of folic acid. This leads to an inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis and de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest and cell death.
