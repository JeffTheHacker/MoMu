it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside compound having 5-iodouracil as the nucleobase; used as an antiviral agent. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside and an organoiodine compound. it is an iodinated analogue of deoxyuridine, with antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and potential radiosensitizing activities. Upon ocular administration, it (IUdR) is converted to its mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms, is incorporated into DNA and disrupts viral replication. Upon oral administration of the it prodrug ropit and hepatic conversion by aldehyde oxidase into it, this agent incorporates into DNA and sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation by increasing DNA strand breaks.
