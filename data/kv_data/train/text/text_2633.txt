it is ergotamine in which a single bond replaces the double bond between positions 9 and 10. A semisynthetic ergot alkaloid with weaker oxytocic and vasoconstrictor properties than ergotamine, it is used (as the methanesulfonic or tartaric acid salts) for the treatment of migraine and orthostatic hypotension. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, a non-narcotic analgesic, a vasoconstrictor agent, a dopamine agonist and a sympatholytic agent. It is an ergot alkaloid and a semisynthetic derivative. it Mesylate is an ergot derivative with agonistic activity for alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic receptors. it mesylate most likely relieves migraine headaches by binding to and stimulating the 5-HT1D receptor subtype, thereby causing constriction of cerebral blood vessels. However, it has also been proposed that it mesylate acts upon 5-HT1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system, thereby decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.
