it is the anhydrous, mesylate salt form of exatecan, a semisynthetic, water-soluble derivative of camptothecin, with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA and inhibiting re-ligation of DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and triggering apoptotic cell death.
