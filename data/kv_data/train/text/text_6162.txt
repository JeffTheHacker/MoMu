it is a benzoate salt obtained by combining equimolar amounts of alogliptin and benzoic acid. Used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has a role as an EC 3.4.14.5 (dipeptidyl-peptidase IV) inhibitor and a hypoglycemic agent. It contains an alogliptin(1+). it is the benzoate salt form of alogliptin, a selective, orally bioavailable, pyrimidinedione-based inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), with hypoglycemic activity. In addition to its effect on glucose levels, alogliptin may inhibit inflammatory responses by preventing the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-mediated formation of proinflammatory cytokines.
