3-Methyl valeric acid, also known as 3-methylvalerate or 3-methyl-N-pentanoic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methyl-branched fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an acyl chain that has a methyl branch. Usually, they are saturated and contain only one or more methyl group. However, branches other than methyl may be present. 3-Methyl valeric acid is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3-Methyl valeric acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3-methyl valeric acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome.
