(NTP, 1992) it is a 1,4-benzodiazepinone that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one substituted by a chloro group at position 7, a hydroxy group at position 3 and phenyl group at position 5. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an anxiolytic drug. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepinone and an organochlorine compound. it is a synthetic benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic and sedative hypnotic properties.
