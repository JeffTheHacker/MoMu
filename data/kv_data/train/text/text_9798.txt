Riboflavine 2', 3', 4', 5'-tetrabutanoate, also known as riboflavin butyrate or vitamin B2 tetrabutyrate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavins. Flavins are compounds containing a flavin (7, 8-dimethyl-benzo[g]pteridine-2, 4-dione) moiety, with a structure characterized by an isoalloaxzine tricyclic ring. Riboflavine 2', 3', 4', 5'-tetrabutanoate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, riboflavine 2', 3', 4', 5'-tetrabutanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
