it is a flavanone glycoside that is pinocembrin attached to a 2-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavanone glycoside, a monohydroxyflavanone, a neohesperidoside, a disaccharide derivative and a (2S)-flavan-4-one. It derives from a pinocembrin.
