it appears as red needle-like crystals or dark brown granular solid. (NTP, 1992) it is a synthetic, red or orange-brown needle-shaped solid that is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol, acetone, benzene and chloroform. It is used as intermediate for the synthesis of both anthraquinone dyes and pharmaceutical products. When it is heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. The primary route of potential human exposure to this chemical is dermal contact. Acute exposure of humans to it can cause irritation of the eyes and skin. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
