Aminofurantoin, also known as afmai, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydantoins. These are heterocyclic compounds containing an imidazolidine substituted by ketone group at positions 2 and 4. Aminofurantoin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Aminofurantoin has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, aminofurantoin is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
