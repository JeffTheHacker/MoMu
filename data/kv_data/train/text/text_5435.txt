it appears as clear to white crystals or white crystalline powder. Odorless. Used as a cardiotonic drug. (EPA, 1998) it is a cardenolide glycoside that is digitoxin beta-hydroxylated at C-12. A cardiac glycoside extracted from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata, it is used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and in the management of congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation, but the margin between toxic and therapeutic doses is small. It has a role as an epitope, an anti-arrhythmia drug, a cardiotonic drug and an EC 3.6.3.9 (Na(+)/K(+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor. It is a cardenolide glycoside and a steroid saponin. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a cardiac glycoside. it inhibits the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump, thereby increasing intracellular calcium and enhancing cardiac contractility. This agent also acts directly on the atrioventricular node to suppress conduction, thereby slowing conduction velocity. Apparently due to its effects on intracellular calcium concentrations, it induces apoptosis of tumor cells via a pathway involving mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspases 8 and 3. (NCI04)
