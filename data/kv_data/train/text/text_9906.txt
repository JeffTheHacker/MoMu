Alpha-Furyl methyl diketone, also known as 1-(2-furanyl)-1, 2-propanedione, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl ketones. These are organic aromatic compounds that contain a ketone group substituted at one C-atom with an aryl group. They have the generic structure RC(=O)R', where R = aryl group and R'=organyl group. Alpha-Furyl methyl diketone exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, Alpha-furyl methyl diketone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Alpha-furyl methyl diketone can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes Alpha-furyl methyl diketone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
