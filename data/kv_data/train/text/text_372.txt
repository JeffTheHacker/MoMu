{2-[4-(4-chloro-1, 2-diphenylbut-1-en-1-yl)phenoxy]ethyl}(methyl)amine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. {2-[4-(4-chloro-1, 2-diphenylbut-1-en-1-yl)phenoxy]ethyl}(methyl)amine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
