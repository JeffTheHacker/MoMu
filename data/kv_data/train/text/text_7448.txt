it is a monothioacetal that consists of cytosine having a (2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl moiety attached at position 1. An inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, it is used as an antiviral in the treatment of AIDS and hepatitis B. It has a role as a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, an antiviral drug, an anti-HBV agent, an allergen, a prodrug and an EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor. It is a monothioacetal, a primary alcohol, an oxacycle and a nucleoside analogue. It derives from a cytosine. it is a synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. Intracellularly, it is phosphorylated to its active metabolites, lamiduvine triphosphate (L-TP) and lamiduvine monophosphate (L-MP). In HIV, L-TP inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleoside analogue into viral DNA. In HBV, incorporation of L-MP into viral DNA by HBV polymerase results in DNA chain termination. L-TP is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases alpha and beta, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase. (NCI04)
