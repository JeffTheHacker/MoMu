Tryptophanamide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tryptamines and derivatives. Tryptamines and derivatives are compounds containing the tryptamine backbone, which is structurally characterized by an indole ring substituted at the 3-position by an ethanamine. Tryptophanamide is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Tryptophanamide has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood.
