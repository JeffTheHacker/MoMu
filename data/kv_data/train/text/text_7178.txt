Pentaerythrite tetranitrate appears as white crystals. Density 1.75 g / cm3. Melting point 138-140Â°C. Detonates at 210Â°C. An extremely dangerous explosive, particularly when dry. Especially sensitive to shock and heat. Primary hazard is blast of an instantaneous explosion, not flying projectiles or fragments. it is a pentaerythritol nitrate in which all four hydroxy groups of pentaerythritol have been converted to the corresponding nitrate ester. It is a vasodilator with properties similar to those of glyceryl trinitrate, but with a more prolonged duration of action, and is used for treatment of angina pectoris. It is also one of the most powerful high explosives known and is a component of the plastic explosive known as Semtex. It has a role as an explosive and a vasodilator agent. it is the lipid soluble polyol ester of nitric acid belonging to the family of nitrovasodilators that exhibit vasodilatory property. it releases free nitric oxide (NO) after denitration reaction, which triggers NO-dependent signaling transduction involving soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). NO binds reversibly to the ferrous-heme center of sGC, thereby causes conformational change and activates the enzyme. Activation results in increasing cellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) within vascular smooth muscle, which results in vasodilation mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Furthermore, this agent causes arterial and venous bed dilation in a dose-dependent manner.
