it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside that is the L-enantiomer of thymine. A synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV DNA polymerase. It has a role as an antiviral drug and an EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor. It derives from a thymine. It is an enantiomer of a thymidine. it is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity highly specific for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Intracellularly, it is phosphorylated to its active metabolite, it triphosphate. The dideoxy it triphosphate competes with thymidine for incorporation into viral DNA, thereby causing DNA chain termination and inhibiting the function of HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). This results in the blockade of HBV DNA replication and viral propagation.
