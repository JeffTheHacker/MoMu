it has been used in trials studying the prevention of HIV. it is a small molecule compound that depletes serum amyloid P component (SAP), with potential anti-amyloid activity. Upon injection, it binds to circulating SAP, forming complexes that are rapidly cleared in the liver. SAP bound to amyloid deposits is in equilibrium with plasma SAP, and depletion of the latter should lead to the eventual removal of SAP from amyloid deposits as well. SAP is a universal component of amyloid deposits and contributes to the pathogenesis of amyloidosis.
