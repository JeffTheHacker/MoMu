Diethylstilbestrol, also known as DES, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. Diethylstilbestrol is a drug which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. previously used in the prevention of miscarriage or premature delivery in pregnant women prone to miscarriage or premature delivery. Diethylstilbestrol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Diethylstilbestrol has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, diethylstilbestrol is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Diethylstilbestrol is formally rated as a carcinogen (by IARC 1) and is also a potentially toxic compound.
