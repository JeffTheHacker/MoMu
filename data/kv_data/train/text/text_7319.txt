4-(2-Amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 4-dioxobutanoic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. 4-(2-Amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 4-dioxobutanoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 4-(2-Amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 4-dioxobutanoic acid has been primarily detected in feces. 4-(2-Amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 4-dioxobutanoic acid and L-glutamic acid can be biosynthesized from L-3-hydroxykynurenine and oxoglutaric acid through its interaction with the enzyme kynurenine/alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase, mitochondrial. In humans, 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 4-dioxobutanoic acid is involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway.
