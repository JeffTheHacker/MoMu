it is a synthetic, dibenzamine alpha adrenergic antagonist with antihypertensive and vasodilatory properties. it non-selectively and irreversibly blocks the postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptor in smooth muscle, thereby preventing vasoconstriction, relieving vasospasms, and decreasing peripheral resistance. Reflex tachycardia may occur and may be enhanced by blockade of alpha-2 receptors which enhances norepinephrine release. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
