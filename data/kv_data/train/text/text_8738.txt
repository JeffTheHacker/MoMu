it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a characteristic odor. Denser (12.3 lb / gal) than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence sinks in water. Nonflammable under most conditions, but burns under extreme conditions. May cause illness by inhalation, skin absorption or ingestion. Used as a solvent, to make other chemicals, as a fumigant. it is a one-carbon compound that is methane in which three of the hydrogens are replaced by chlorines. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic, a non-polar solvent, a carcinogenic agent, a central nervous system drug and a refrigerant. It is a one-carbon compound and a member of chloromethanes. it is a colorless, volatile, liquid derivative of it with an ether-like odor. Formerly used as an inhaled anesthetic during surgery, the primary use of it today is in industry, where it is used as a solvent and in the production of the refrigerant freon. Acute it toxicity results in impaired liver function, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea and central nervous system dysfunction. As a byproduct of water chlorination, it may be present in small amounts in chlorinated water. (NCI04)
