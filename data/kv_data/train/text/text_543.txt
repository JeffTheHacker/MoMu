it is the 17-O-propionate ester of clobetasol. A potent corticosteroid, it is used to treat various skin disorders, including exzema and psoriasis. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a glucocorticoid, a fluorinated steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a chlorinated steroid. It derives from a clobetasol and a propionic acid. it is the propionate salt form of clobetasol, a topical synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. it exerts its effect by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. This results in synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins, while inhibiting the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators. Specifically, it appears to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, thereby controlling the release of the inflammatory precursor arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.
