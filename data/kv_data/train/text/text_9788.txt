1, 7-Dihydroxy-3-methoxy-2-prenylxanthone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-prenylated xanthones. These are organic compounds containing a C5-isoprenoid group linked to a xanthone moiety at the 2-position. Xanthone is a tricyclic compound made up of two benzene rings linearly fused to each other through a pyran ring that carries a ketone group. 1, 7-Dihydroxy-3-methoxy-2-prenylxanthone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 1, 7-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-2-prenylxanthone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 1, 7-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-2-prenylxanthone can be found in fruits. This makes 1, 7-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-2-prenylxanthone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
