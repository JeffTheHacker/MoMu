it is a six-membered homodetic cyclic peptide composed from L-phenylglycyl, D-tryptophyl, L-lysyl, O-benzyl-L-tyrosyl, L-phenylalanyl and modified L-hydroxyproline residues joined in sequence. A somatostatin analogue with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin; used (as its diaspartate salt) for treatment of Cushing's disease. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a peptide hormone. It is a conjugate base of a it(2+). it is a synthetic long-acting cyclic peptide with somatostatin-like activity. it activates a broad spectrum of somatostatin receptors, exhibiting a much higher binding affinity for somatostatin receptors 1, 3, and 5 than octreotide in vitro, as well as a comparable binding affinity for somatostatin receptor 2. This agent is more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting the release of human growth hormone (HGH), glucagon, and insulin.
