Picrotoxinin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as furopyrans. These are organic polycyclic compounds containing a furan ring fused to a pyran ring. Furan is a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen atom. Pyran a six-membered heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring, made up of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom and containing two double bonds. Picrotoxinin is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa).
