it is an organic molecular entity. It has a role as a SMO receptor agonist. it is a topical, synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties. it exerts its effect by interacting with specific intracellular receptors, and the ligand-receptor complex subsequently modulates gene expressions via the typical glucocorticoid signalling pathway. This results in the synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins as well as in synthesis inhibition of certain inflammatory mediators. Consequently, an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions are accomplished. (NCI05)
