it is a cannabinoid isolated from the plant Cannabis that is a metabolite of tetrahydroit (THC), with potential immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities. it preferentially binds to the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptor CB2, which is mainly expressed on a variety of immune cells, such as T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Stimulation of CB2 receptors by it may both trigger apoptosis in these cells and inhibit the production of a variety of cytokines. it exerts minimal affinity for CB1 and has a weak effect on the central nervous system.
