it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-methyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2-methyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine can be found in cereals and cereal products and nuts. This makes 2-methyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
