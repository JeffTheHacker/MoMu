it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pterocarpans. These are benzo-pyrano-furano-benzene compounds, containing the 6H-[1]benzofuro[3, 2-c]chromene skeleton. They are derivatives of isoflavonoids. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in pulses and soy bean. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
