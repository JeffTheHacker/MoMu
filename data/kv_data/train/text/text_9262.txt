it, also known as fema 2813, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohol esters. These are ester derivatives of a fatty alcohol. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, octyl propanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a sweet, floral, and fruity tasting compound that can be found in parsnip. This makes octyl propanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
