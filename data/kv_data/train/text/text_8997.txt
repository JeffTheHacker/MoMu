it is a member of the class of phenothiazines that is perazine substituted by a ethylsulfanyl group at position 2. It has a role as a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, a histamine antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a dopaminergic antagonist and an antiemetic. It is a member of phenothiazines and a N-methylpiperazine. It derives from a perazine. it is a piperazine phenothiazine derivative and a dopamine antagonist used as antiemetic. it blocks postsynaptic dopamine 2 (D2) receptors in the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), thereby decreasing stimulation of the vomiting center in the brain.
