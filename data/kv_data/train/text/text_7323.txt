it is a chemical weapon which is related to sarin. Structurally, it differs from sarin only in that the fluorine atom in sarin is replaced by a chlorine atom in it. This change is only expected to have a small effect on it's chemical reactivity as compared to the reactivity of sarin. See the chemical datasheet for sarin for more information.
