it, also known as diacylglycerol(29:0) or DAG(12:0/17:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 2-diacylglycerols. These are diacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at positions 1 and 2. Thus, it is considered to be a diradylglycerol lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
