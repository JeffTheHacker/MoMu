it is a vibsane diterpenoid that is (2Z,6E,10E)-cycloundeca-2,6,10-trien-1-one which is substituted at positions 2, 5, 5, 8, 9, and 9 by hydroxymethyl, methyl, 2-methylpent-2-en-5-yl, 3-methylbut-2-enoyloxy, hydroxy, and methyl groups, respectively (the 5S,8R,9R stereoisomer). It has been found to inhibit root growth in rice seedlings (IC50 0.14 mM). It has a role as a plant metabolite and a plant growth retardant. It is a vibsane diterpenoid, an enone, a cyclic terpene ketone and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid.
