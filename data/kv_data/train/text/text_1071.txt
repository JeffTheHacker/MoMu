Sucralfate is a medication that is widely used to prevent and treat a number of diseases in the gastrointestinal tract such as duodenal ulcers, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, stress ulcer, in addition to dyspepsia.  It is considered a cytoprotective agent, protecting cells in the gastrointestinal tract from damage caused by agents such as gastric acid, bile salts, alcohol, and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), among other substances.  Sucralfate has been shown to be a well-tolerated and safe drug. It is sold under many brands and is available in both tablet and suspension forms.  It was approved by the FDA  1982 in tablet form, and in 1994 for the suspension form. Sucralfate is a nonabsorbable, aluminum salt of sucrose orasulfate with anti-ulcer, mucosa-protective and potentially anti-mucositis activity. Negatively charged sucralfate binds, through ionic bond formation, to positively charged proteins on mucosal surfaces, thereby creating a protective coating and physical barrier. This agent may also enhance the production of prostaglandin E2 locally, thereby promoting mucus production, increasing mucosal blood flow and stimulating epithelial proliferation and may contribute to the healing of damaged mucosa.
