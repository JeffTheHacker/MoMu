(+)-Sesamin, also known as episesamin or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as furanoid lignans. These are lignans with a structure that contains either a tetrahydrofuran ring, a furan ring, or a furofuan ring system, that arises from the joining of the two phenylpropanoid units (+)-Sesamin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (+)-sesamin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (+)-sesamin can be found in a number of food items such as sesame, flaxseed, ucuhuba, and fats and oils. This makes (+)-sesamin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
