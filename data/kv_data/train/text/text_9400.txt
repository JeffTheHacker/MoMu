6-Hydroxy-2-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]-2, 3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-one belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aurone flavonoids. These are flavonoids containing a 2-Benzylidene-1-benzofuran-3-one based core. Aurone flavonoids provide the bright yellow color of some important ornamental flowers, such as snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus). 6-Hydroxy-2-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]-2, 3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
