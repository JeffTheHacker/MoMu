it is the isopropyl ester of prostaglandin F2alpha in which the pentyl group is replaced by a 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxymethyl group. A synthetic analogue of prostaglandin F2alpha, ophthalmic solutions of it are used as a topical medication for controlling the progression of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure. It is a pro-drug; the isopropyl ester group is hydrolysed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active free acid, fluprostenol. It has a role as an antiglaucoma drug, an antihypertensive agent, a prodrug, an ophthalmology drug and a prostaglandin receptor agonist. It is a prostaglandins Falpha, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and an isopropyl ester. It derives from a fluprostenol. it is a synthetic lipophilic isopropyl ester prodrug of the active compound it free acid, a prostaglandin F2alpha analog with anti-glaucoma property. Upon administration, it is hydrolysed to a free acid by corneal esterases, and then selectively stimulating the prostaglandin F (FP prostanoid) receptor, thereby increasing the uveoscleral outflow which leads to a reduction in intra-ocular pressure.
