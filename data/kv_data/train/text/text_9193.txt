it, also known as it or fema 3725, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha-branched alpha, beta-unsaturated ketones. These are alpha, beta-unsaturated ketones that carry a branch on the alpha carbon. They have the generic structure RC(=O)C(R')=C, R = organyl group and R'= any heteroatom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-methylene-2-octanone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it has a mushroom and musty taste.
