it is a carbohydrazide resulting from the formal condensation of the hydrazone moiety of 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde hydrazone with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. It is a cell-permeable, reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of the GTPase activity of dynamin 1 and 2 and Drp1 (mitochondrial), while exhibiting no significant effect against two other small GTPases, MxA and Cdc42. It has a role as an EC 3.6.5.5 (dynamin GTPase) inhibitor. It is a member of catechols, a member of naphthols, a hydrazide and a hydrazone. It derives from a 3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate.
