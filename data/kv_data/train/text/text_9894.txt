Methionine and derivatives are compounds containing methionine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of methionine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa).
