Choloyl-CoA, also known as cholyl-CoA or cholyl-coenzyme A, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl coas. These are acyl-CoAs carrying a 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl chain. Choloyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Choloyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, choloyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Choloyl-CoA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Choloyl-CoA and taurine can be converted into taurocholic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme bile acid-coa:amino acid N-acyltransferase. In addition, Choloyl-CoA and glycine can be converted into glycocholic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme bile acid-coa:amino acid N-acyltransferase. In humans, choloyl-CoA is involved in bile acid biosynthesis pathway, congenital bile acid synthesis defect type II pathway, congenital bile acid synthesis defect type III pathway, and the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) pathway. Choloyl-CoA is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include the familial hypercholanemia (fhca) pathway, the zellweger syndrome pathway, and 27-hydroxylase deficiency.
