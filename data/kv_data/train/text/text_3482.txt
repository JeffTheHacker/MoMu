Raffinose, also known as delta-raffinose or gossypose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. Raffinose exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Raffinose has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and blood. Within the cell, raffinose is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Raffinose participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Raffinose and D-galactose can be biosynthesized from stachyose through its interaction with the enzyme Alpha-galactosidase a. In addition, Raffinose can be converted into sucrose and D-galactose; which is mediated by the enzyme Alpha-galactosidase a. In humans, raffinose is involved in the galactose metabolism pathway. Raffinose is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the galactosemia pathway.
