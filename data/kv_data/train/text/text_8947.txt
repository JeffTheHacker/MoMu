it is an oral, selective, reversible, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both ErbB-2 (Her-2/neu) and EGFR. Over-expression of ErbB-2 and EGFR receptors in tumors is predictive of poor prognosis in cancer patients. it has shown significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of human breast, lung, and epidermal carcinoma tumors. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor family with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively and reversibly binds to both EGFR (ErbB-1) and Her-2/neu (ErbB-2) and prevents their phosphorylation and activation, which may result in inhibition of the associated signal transduction pathways, inhibition of cellular proliferation and cell death. EGFR and Her-2 play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation and are upregulated in various human tumor cell types. Due to the dual inhibition of both EGFR and Her-2, this agent may be therapeutically more effective than agents that inhibit EGFR or Her-2 alone.
