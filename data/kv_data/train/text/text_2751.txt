it is a hexose derivative that is 2,3:4,5-di-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose in which the hydroxy group has been converted to the corresponding sulfamate ester. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels and is used as an antiepileptic and for the prevention of migraine. It has a role as an anticonvulsant and a sodium channel blocker. It is a cyclic ketal, a sulfamate ester and a ketohexose derivative. it is a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide with anticonvulsant property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it antagonizes kainate/AMPA subtype of the glutamate receptors, which are ligand-activated cation channels that mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons of the central nervous system. This antagonistic action results in stabilizing hyper-excited neural membranes, inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing, and decreasing propagation of synaptic impulses, thereby impedes seizure occurrences. In addition, this agent augments gamma-aminobenzoic acid (GABA) activity and thereby attenuating GABAnergic inhibitory transmission.
