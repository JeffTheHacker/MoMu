it appears as a white crystalline volatile solid with a strong coal-tar odor. The solid is denser than water and insoluble in water. Burns, but may be difficult to ignite. .  In the molten form it is very hot. Exposure to skin must be avoided. Also the vapors given off by the material may be toxic.  Used as a moth repellent, fumigant, lubricants, and to make other chemicals, and for many other uses it is an aromatic hydrocarbon comprising two fused benzene rings. It occurs in the essential oils of numerous plant species e.g. magnolia. It has a role as a volatile oil component, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a carcinogenic agent, a mouse metabolite and an apoptosis inhibitor. It is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene and a member of its. it is a white, volatile, solid polycyclic hydrocarbon with a strong mothball odor. it is obtained from either coal tar or petroleum distillation and is primarily used to manufacture phthalic anhydride, but is also used in moth repellents. Exposure to it is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver and neurological system, cataracts and retinal hemorrhage. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen and may be associated with an increased risk of developing laryngeal and colorectal cancer.
