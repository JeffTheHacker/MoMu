it is a sialotetraosylceramide consisting of a branched pentasaccharide made up from one sialyl residue, two galactose residues, one N-acetylgalactosamine residue and a glucose residue at the reducing end attached to N-stearoylsphingosine via a beta-linkage. It is a sialotetraosylceramide and an alpha-N-acetylneuraminosyl-(2->3)-[beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)]-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1<->1')-N-acylsphingosine. It contains a ->8)-alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->3)-[beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1->4)]-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-yl group. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-).
