(e)-3-(2, 3-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid, also known as 3-(2, 3-dihydroxyphenyl)acrylate or adpribose 2'-phosphate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxycinnamic acids. Hydroxycinnamic acids are compounds containing an cinnamic acid where the benzene ring is hydroxylated (e)-3-(2, 3-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (e)-3-(2, 3-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm (e)-3-(2, 3-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid can be biosynthesized from cinnamic acid. Outside of the human body, (e)-3-(2, 3-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid can be found in roman camomile. This makes (e)-3-(2, 3-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
