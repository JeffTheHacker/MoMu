Oripavine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic. Oripavine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, oripavine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, oripavine can be found in a number of food items such as saskatoon berry, purslane, lettuce, and lowbush blueberry. This makes oripavine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
