it is a macrocyclic lactone derived from Streptomyces cyanogriseus with antiparasitic activity. Upon administration, it may bind to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and/or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters expressed on nematode neurons and pharyngeal muscle cells. As a result, neurons or muscle cells remain at either hyperpolarization or depolarization state, thereby resulting in muscle paralysis. it reduces the motility and fertility of the parasite and its excretion of immunomodulatory proteins, and inhibits the release of microfilariae.
