it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Neoplasms. it is a water-insoluble heterocyclic amide with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits topoisomerases I and II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair, and RNA and protein synthesis. The acetylated form of it is highly toxic and is capable of inducing unscheduled DNA synthesis; rapid acetylators are more likely to experience toxicity with this agent.
