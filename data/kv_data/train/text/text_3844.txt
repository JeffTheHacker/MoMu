it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as monothioketals. Monothioketals are compounds containing a monothioketal functional group with the general structure R2C(OR')(SR') with (R = any atom but H). it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, dihydro-2-methoxy-2-methyl-3(2H)-thiophenone is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
