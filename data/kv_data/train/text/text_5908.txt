it is a benzenetriol that is phenethylamine in which the hydrogens at positions 2, 4, and 5 on the phenyl ring are replaced by hydroxy groups. It occurs naturally in human urine, but is also produced as a metabolite of the drug DOPA (used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease). It has a role as a neurotoxin, a human metabolite and a drug metabolite. It is a primary amino compound, a benzenetriol and a catecholamine. It derives from a dopamine. it is an antagonist of the neurotransmitter dopamine with potential antineoplastic activity. it (6-HOD) can be taken up by selective adrenergic terminals, thereby causing acute degeneration of adrenergic terminals that leads to depletion of norepinephrine, and of dopamine in the dopamine-sensitive sites. This agent is auto-oxidated at physiological pH that leads to the formation of reactive free radicals, thereby leading to cytotoxicity in neural cells. it is often used to induce CNS and sympathetic neural lesions that model aging and various nervous disorders in animal systems.
