Iodipamide Meglumine is the meglumine salt form of iodipamide, a tri-iodinated benzoate derivative and an ionic dimeric contrast agent used in diagnostic imaging. When administered in vivo, iodipamide is removed from the liver and secreted into the biliary tract. Like other organic iodine compounds, this agent blocks x-ray and appears opaque on x-ray film; thereby it enhances the visibility of the bile ducts and gallbladder during cholangiography and cholecystography procedures.
