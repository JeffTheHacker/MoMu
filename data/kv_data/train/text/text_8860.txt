it appears as odorless white or almost white crystalline powder. Slightly bitter taste; pleasant aftertaste. (NTP, 1992) it is a sulfonamide in which the nitrogen of 4-sulfamoylbenzoic acid is substituted with two propyl groups. It has a role as a uricosuric drug. It is a sulfonamide and a member of benzoic acids. it is a benzoic acid derivative with antihyperuricemic property. it competitively inhibits the active reabsorption of urate at the proximal tubule in the kidney thereby increasing urinary excretion of uric acid and lowering serum urate concentrations. This prevents urate deposition and promotes resolution of existing urate deposits. In addition, it modulates the transport of organic acids and acidic drugs at the proximal and distal renal tubule, thereby increasing the drug serum concentration.
