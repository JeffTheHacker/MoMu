it is a member of the class of piperidines that is piperidine having a 2-(4-ethyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)ethyl group at the 1-position as well as N-phenylpropanamido- and methoxymethyl groups at the 4-position. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an intravenous anaesthetic, a central nervous system depressant and a peripheral nervous system drug. It is a member of piperidines and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a synthetic short-acting opioid with analgesic and local anesthesia enhancing activity. it primarily binds to mu-opioid receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, thereby mimicking the actions of morphine, the prototypical mu receptor agonist. This agent induces anti-nociception responses mediated through inhibiting the release of various neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline; in addition, the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon are also inhibited.
