it is the fumarate salt of a synthetic phenoxy-2-propanol-derived cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with antihypertensive and potential cardioprotective activities. Devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, bisoprolol selectively and competitively binds to and blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, decreasing cardiac contractility and rate, reducing cardiac output, and lowering blood pressure. In addition, this agent may exhibit antihypertensive activity through the inhibition of renin secretion by juxtaglomerular epithelioid (JGE) cells in the kidney, thus inhibiting activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Bisoprolol has been shown to be cardioprotective in animal models.
