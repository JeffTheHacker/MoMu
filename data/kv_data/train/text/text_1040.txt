it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxyphenols. Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, pepper (c. frutescens), and pepper (c. annuum). This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
