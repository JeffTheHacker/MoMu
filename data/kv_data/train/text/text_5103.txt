it is a hydrochloride resulting from the combination of equimolar amounts of midodrine and hydrogen chloride. Midodrine is a direct-acting sympathomimetic with selective alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. The hydrochloride salt is used as a peripheral vasoconstrictor in the treatment of certain hypotensive states. The main active moiety is its major metabolite, deglymidodrine. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent and a vasoconstrictor agent. It contains a midodrine(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of midodrine, a direct-acting prodrug and sympathomimetic agent with antihypotensive properties. Midodrine is converted to its active metabolite, desglymidodrine by deglycination reaction. Desglymidodrine selectively binds to and activates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature. This causes smooth muscle contraction and leads to an elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine diffuses poorly across the blood-brain barrier, and is therefore not associated with effects on the central nervous system.
