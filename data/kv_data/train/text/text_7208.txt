it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl-alpha amino acids and derivatives. N-acyl-alpha amino acids and derivatives are compounds containing an alpha amino acid (or a derivative thereof) which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fishes. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
