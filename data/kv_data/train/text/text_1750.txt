Geniposidic acid, also known as geniposidate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as iridoid o-glycosides. These are iridoid monoterpenes containing a glycosyl (usually a pyranosyl) moiety linked to the iridoid skeleton. Geniposidic acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, geniposidic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, geniposidic acid can be found in beverages and fruits. This makes geniposidic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
