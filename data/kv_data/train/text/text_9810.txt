it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid-7-o-glycosides. These are phenolic compounds containing a flavonoid moiety which is O-glycosidically linked to carbohydrate moiety at the C7-position. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, hesperetin 7-neohesperidoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, hesperetin 7-neohesperidoside can be found in a number of food items such as sweet orange, mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine), grapefruit, and lime. This makes hesperetin 7-neohesperidoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
