it is a member of the class of phenothiazines that is 10H-phenothiazine substituted by a (2R)-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylpropyl group and a methoxy group at positions 10 and 2 respectively. It has a role as a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, a dopaminergic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a cholinergic antagonist, a non-narcotic analgesic, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of phenothiazines and a tertiary amine. It derives from a hydride of a 10H-phenothiazine. it is a phenothiazine and typical antipsychotic agent, with sedative/hypnotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, analgesic and antipsychotic activities. Although the exact mechanism of action of it is not fully known, upon administration, this agent appears to act as an antagonist for a variety of receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), including adrenergic, dopamine, histamine, cholinergic and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptors. Blocking these receptors results in it's pharmacologic effects.
