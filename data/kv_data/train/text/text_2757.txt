Alpha-Guaiene, also known as A-guaiene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Alpha-Guaiene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-guaiene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Alpha-Guaiene is a sweet, balsamic, and peppery tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as pepper (spice), sweet basil, sweet bay, and burdock. This makes Alpha-guaiene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
