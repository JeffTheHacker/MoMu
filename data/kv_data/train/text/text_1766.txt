1-(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-1-butanone, also known as 2', 4'-dihydroxybutyrophenone or 4-butyrylresorcinol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. 1-(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-1-butanone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-butanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
