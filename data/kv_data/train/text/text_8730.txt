it is a cyclopentapyran that is 1,4a,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran-4-carboxylic acid substituted at positions 1 and 7 by beta-D-glucosyloxy and methyl groups respectively (the 1S,4aS,7S,7aR-diatereomer). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a cyclopentapyran, a monoterpene glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an iridoid monoterpenoid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a 7-deoxyloganetic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 7-deoxyloganate.
