The serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are potent antiemetics used for prevention of postsurgical or chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and for some agents as therapy of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are associated with a low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but have been only rarely implicated in cases of clinically apparent liver injury. it is an indazole derivative with antiemetic properties. As a selective serotonin receptor antagonist, it competitively blocks the action of serotonin at 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors, resulting in the suppression of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
