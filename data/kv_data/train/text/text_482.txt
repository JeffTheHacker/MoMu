Fenoprofen calcium is the dihydrate form of the calcium salt of fenoprofen. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it is used for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with disorders such as arthritis. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, an antipyretic and a non-narcotic ait. It contains a fenoprofen calcium (anhydrous). Fenoprofen Calcium is the calcium salt form of fenoprofen, a propionic acid derivative with ait, non-steroidal antiinflammatory and antirheumatic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits both isozymes of cyclooxygenase; resulting in prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In addition, fenoprofen activate both peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, by which it may down-regulate leukotriene B4 production.
