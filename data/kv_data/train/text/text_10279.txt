it is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine with the hydroxy group of N-benzoyl-L-phenylalaninol. A metabolite found in several Pencillium and Aspergillus species, as well as in plants as a product of endophytic fungi. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a L-phenylalanine derivative, a member of benzamides and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine and a N-benzoyl-L-phenylalaninol.
