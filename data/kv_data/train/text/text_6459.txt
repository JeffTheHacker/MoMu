it is a biphenylyltetrazole. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and an angiotensin receptor antagonist. it is a synthetic imidazole derivative and angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive activity. it selectively binds to the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor subtype in vascular smooth muscle and adrenal gland, thereby competing with angiotensin II for binding to the AT1 receptor. This prevents angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and interferes with angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion, thereby decreasing aldosterone production and preventing aldosterone-stimulated sodium retention and potassium excretion.
