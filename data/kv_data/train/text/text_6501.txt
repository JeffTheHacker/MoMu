it is a monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens is substituted by a 1,8-diethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano[3,4-b]indol-1-yl moiety. A preferential inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase 2 and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, it is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and for the alleviation of postoperative pain. Administered as the racemate, only the (S)-enantiomer is active. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic and an antipyretic. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an organic heterotricyclic compound. it is a pyranocarboxylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with antipyretic and analgesic activities. it inhibits the activity of cyclooxygenase I and II, thereby preventing the formation of prostaglandin which is involved in the induction of pain, fever, and inflammation. It also inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking platelet cyclooxygenase and the subsequent formation of thromboxane A2.
