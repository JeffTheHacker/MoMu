it is an organic sodium salt that is the monosodium salt of tolmetin. Used in the form of its dihydrate as a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It has a role as an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It contains a tolmetin(1-). it is the sodium salt form of tolmetin, an arylalkanoic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities. Although the exact mechanism through which tolmetin exerts its effects has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent appears to inhibit the enzyme prostaglandin synthase. This prevents the formation of prostaglandins from prostaglandin precursors, including the synthesis of the inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from the precursor prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). This prevents prostaglandin-mediated effects, including pain, inflammation and fever.
