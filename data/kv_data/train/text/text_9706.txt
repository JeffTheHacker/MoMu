it is a C21-steroid hormone that is 1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione carrying four hydroxy substituents at positions 11beta, 16alpha, 17alpha and 21 as well as a fluoro substituent at position 9. Used in the form of its 16,17-acetonide to treat various skin infections. It has a role as an anti-allergic agent and an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a fluorinated steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a glucocorticoid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 16alpha-hydroxy steroid, a C21-steroid hormone, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane. it is a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. Upon cell entry, it binds to and activates the glucocorticoid receptor, which leads to translocation of the ligand-receptor complex to the nucleus and induces expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes such as lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both mediators of inflammation. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including interleukin (IL)-1and IL-6, and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is also inhibited. T-cells are prevented from making IL-2 and proliferating. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis through increasing Ikappa-B expression and curtailing activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappa-B.
