it is a naphthalenecarboxamide obtained from formal condensation of the carboxy group of aminocyclopropyl)methoxy]-6-methoxyquinolin-4-yl}oxy)-1-naphthoic acid with methylamine. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonist and a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist. It is a member of quinolines, an aromatic ether, a member of cyclopropanes, a primary amino compound and a naphthalenecarboxamide. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a novel dual inhibitor targeting human vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) with antiangiogenic activity. it inhibits VEGFR-1, -2, -3 and FGFR-1, -2 kinases in the nM range, which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, and the induction of tumor cell death. Both VEGFRs and FGFRs belong to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases that may be upregulated in various tumor cell types.
