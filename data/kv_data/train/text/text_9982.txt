it is a quinolone that is 1-methylquinolin-2-one which carries a 3-chlorophenyl and an amino(4-chlorophenyl)(1-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)methyl groups at the 4 and 6 positions, respectively (the R-isomer). It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.5.1.58 (protein farnesyltransferase) inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a quinolone, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of imidazoles and a primary amino compound. it is a nonpeptidomimetic quinolinone with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase, an enzyme involved in protein processing (farnesylation) for signal transduction. By inhibiting the farnesylation of proteins, this agent prevents the activation of Ras oncogenes, inhibits cell growth, induces apoptosis, and inhibits angiogenesis. (NCI04)
