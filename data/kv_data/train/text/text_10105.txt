2, 4-Diisopropyl-5-methylphenol, also known as 2, 4, 5-trimethyl-phenol or 1-hydroxy-2, 4, 5-trimethylbenzene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. 2, 4-Diisopropyl-5-methylphenol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 4-diisopropyl-5-methylphenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 4-diisopropyl-5-methylphenol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 4-diisopropyl-5-methylphenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
