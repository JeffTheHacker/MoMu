it is a fine white crystalline powder. Odorless with a slightly bitter taste. Melting point 41-45Â°C. A 2% solution has pH of 4 to 6. Used medicinally as an antineoplastic agent. it is a phosphorodiamide that is 1,3,2-oxazaphosphinan-2-amine 2-oxide substituted by two 2-chloroethyl groups at the amino nitrogen atom. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, an alkylating agent, an immunosuppressive agent, an antineoplastic agent, an antirheumatic drug, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a phosphorodiamide, a nitrogen mustard and an organochlorine compound. it Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of it, a synthetic nitrogen mustard alkylating agent, with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities. In the liver, it is converted to active metabolites including phosphoramide mustard, which binds to and crosslinks DNA and RNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and protein synthesis. This agent, at low doses, is also a potent immunosuppressant primarily by depleting T-regulatory cells.
