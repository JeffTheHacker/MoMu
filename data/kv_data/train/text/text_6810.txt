it is a benzochromene that is 2H-benzo[h]chromene which is substituted by two methyl groups at position 2, a methoxycarbonyl group at position 5, and a hydroxy group at position 6. Found in the Chinese medical plant Rubia cordifola, It has an anti-cancer effect by inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. It is also a dual inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (ACAT1 and ACAT2), but is more selective for the ACAT2 isozyme. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 inhibitor, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer, a neuroprotective agent and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a benzochromene, a methyl ester and a member of phenols.
