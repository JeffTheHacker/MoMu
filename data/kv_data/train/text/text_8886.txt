Chlorprothixene, also known as chlothixen, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thioxanthenes. These are organic polycyclic compounds containing a thioxanthene moiety, which is an aromatic tricycle derived from xanthene by replacing the oxygen atom with a sulfur atom. Chlorprothixene is a drug which is used for treatment of psychotic disorders (e. g. schizophrenia) and of acute mania occuring as part of bipolar disorders. Chlorprothixene exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Chlorprothixene has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, chlorprothixene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Chlorprothixene can be converted into (Z)-chlorprothixene. Chlorprothixene is a potentially toxic compound.
