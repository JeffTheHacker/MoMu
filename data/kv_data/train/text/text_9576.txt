it, also known as cinchonifine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cinchona alkaloids. These are alkaloids structurally characterized by the presence of the cinchonan skeleton, which consists of a quinoline linked to an azabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane moiety. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, hydrocinchonine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, hydrocinchonine can be found in fruits. This makes hydrocinchonine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
