Luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside is a glycosyloxyflavone that is luteolin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a trihydroxyflavone and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a luteolin. It is a conjugate acid of a luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside(1-).
