Menthone 1, 3-glyceryl ketal belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. Menthone 1, 3-glyceryl ketal is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, menthone 1, 3-glyceryl ketal is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
