Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. Thus, is considered to be an oxygenated hydrocarbon lipid molecule. exists as a liquid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). is a sweet, fresh, and fruity tasting compound that can be found in fruits. This makes a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
