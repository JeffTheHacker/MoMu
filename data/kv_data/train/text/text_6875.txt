Penicilloic acid, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl-alpha amino acids. N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. Penicilloic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Penicilloic acid has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, penicilloic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
