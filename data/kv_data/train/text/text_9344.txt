it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as c19-gibberellin 6-carboxylic acids. These are c19-gibberellins with a carboxyl group at the 6-position. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits, peach, and sour cherry. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
