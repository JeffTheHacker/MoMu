it, also known as it or dencichin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl-alpha amino acids. N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in pulses. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
