Chlormerodrin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoureas. These are organic compounds containing the isourea group, with the general structure R1N(R2)C(=NR3)OR4, or its hydrocarbyl derivatives (R1, R2, R3, R4=H, alkyl, aryl). Chlormerodrin exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Chlormerodrin has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood.
