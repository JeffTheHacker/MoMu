4-hydroxy-17beta-estradiol is a 4-hydroxy steroid that consists of 17beta-estradiol having an additional hydroxy group at position 4. It has a role as a metabolite. It derives from a 17beta-estradiol. it is a metabolite formed during the metabolism of 17beta-estradiol by hydroxylation of the carbon at position 4 by cytochrome P450 1B1, with potential carcinogenic activity. The mechanism of action for the tumor promoting activity of it (4-OHE2) is not entirely known but this metabolite undergoes metabolic redox cycling with its oxidized quinoid form, estradiol 3,4-quinone, and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce oxidative DNA damage. 4-OHE2 also activates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and induces the expression of certain genes through activation of the estrogen receptor (ER), which stimulates cellular proliferation in susceptible cells.
