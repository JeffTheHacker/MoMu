1, 3-Diphenylprop-2-en-1-one, also known as alpha-benzylideneacetophenone or beta-benzoylstyrene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as retrochalcones. These are a form of normal chalcones that are structurally distinguished by the lack of oxygen functionalities at the C2'- and C6'-positions. 1, 3-Diphenylprop-2-en-1-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 1, 3-Diphenylprop-2-en-1-one can be converted into 2', 3, 4, 4', 6'-pentahydroxychalcone.
