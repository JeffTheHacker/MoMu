it has been used in trials studying the treatment of HIV Infection, Adult Gliosarcoma, Adult Glioblastoma, Stage I Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma, and Stage II Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma, among others. it is a guanine analogue with antineoplastic activity. O6-benzylguanine binds the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), transferring the benzyl moiety to the active-site cysteine and resulting in inhibition of AGT-mediated DNA repair. Co-administration of this agent potentiates the effects of other chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA. (NCI04)
