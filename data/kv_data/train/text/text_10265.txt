11, 12, 13-Trinor-1(10)-spirovetivene-2, 7-dione, also known as 6, 10-dimethylspiro[4. 5]dec-6-ene-2, 8-dione, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenones are compounds containing a cylohexenone moiety, which is a six-membered aliphatic ring that carries a ketone and has one endocyclic double bond. 11, 12, 13-Trinor-1(10)-spirovetivene-2, 7-dione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 11, 12, 13-trinor-1(10)-spirovetivene-2, 7-dione is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 11, 12, 13-trinor-1(10)-spirovetivene-2, 7-dione can be found in potato. This makes 11, 12, 13-trinor-1(10)-spirovetivene-2, 7-dione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
