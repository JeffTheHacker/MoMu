Vinyl ethyl ether appears as a clear colorless low-boiling liquid (35-36Â°C) with an ether-like odor. Flash point below -50Â°F. May polymerize exothermically if heated or contaminated. If polymerization takes place inside a container, the container may rupture violently. Less dense than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors are heavier than air.
