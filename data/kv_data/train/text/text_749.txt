it is a naphthoquinone compound having a 4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl group at the 2-position and a hydroxy substituent at the 3-position. It has a role as an antimalarial, an antifungal agent, an EC 1.3.5.2 [dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor, an EC 1.6.5.3 [NADH:ubiquinone reductase (H(+)-translocating)] inhibitor and an EC 1.10.2.2 (quinol--cytochrome-c reductase) inhibitor. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes and a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. it is a synthetic hydroxynaphthoquinone with antiprotozoal activity. Atovoquone blocks the mitochondrial electron transport at complex III of the respiratory chain of protozoa, thereby inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis, preventing DNA synthesis and leading to protozoal death.
