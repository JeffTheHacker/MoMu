it is a monocarboxylic acid consisting of phenylacetic acid having a (2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino group at the 2-position. It has a role as a non-narcotic analgesic, an antipyretic, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a drug allergen and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is a secondary amino compound, an amino acid, a dichlorobenzene, an aromatic amine and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a phenylacetic acid and a diphenylamine. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a nonsteroidal benzeneacetic acid derivative with anti-inflammatory activity. As a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it binds and chelates both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and-2), thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory-proprostaglandins. This agent also may inhibit COX-2-mediated tumor angiogenesis. When inhibiting COX-2, it may be effective in relieving pain and inflammation; when inhibiting COX-1, it may produce unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects. This agent may be more active against COX-2 than several other carboxylic acid-containing NSAIDs. (NCI04)
