it is a steroid lactone of Chan su (toad venom), a Chinese medicine obtained from the skin venom gland of toads. A specific Na/K-ATPase protein inhibitor, it is used as a cardiotonic and central nervous system (CNS) respiratory agent, an analgesic and anesthetic, and as a remedy for ulcers. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.9 (Na(+)/K(+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor. It is a steroid lactone and an epoxy steroid. It derives from a bufanolide. it is a bufadienolide toxin originally isolated from the venom of the Chinese toad Bufo gargarizans; it is also one of the glycosides in the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu, with potential cardiotonic activity. Although the mechanism of action of bufogenin is still under investigation, this agent is a specific Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor and has been shown to reduce blood pressure in a rat model of preeclampsia.
