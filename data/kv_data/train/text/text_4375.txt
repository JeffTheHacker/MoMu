it is a monocarboxylic acid that is 4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid which is substituted on the nitrogen by a cyclopropyl group and at positions 6, 7, and 8 by fluoro, 3-methylpiperazin-1-yl, and methoxy groups, respectively. it is an antibiotic of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family, that like other members of that family, inhibits the bacterial topoisomerase type-II enzymes. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor and an antimicrobial agent. It is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid, a N-arylpiperazine, an organofluorine compound, a quinolone and a quinolone antibiotic. it is a synthetic 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. it exerts its effect through inhibition of DNA gyrase, an enzyme involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair, and inhibition of topoisomerase IV, an enzyme involved in partitioning of chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division.
