it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Renal impairment, Hepatic Impairment, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and High Level of Sugar (Glucose) in the Blood. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter subtype 1 (SGLT1) and 2 (SGLT2), with potential antihyperglycemic activity. Upon oral administration, it binds to and blocks both SGLT1 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and SGLT2 in the kidneys, thereby suppressing the absorption of glucose from the GI tract and the reabsorption of glucose by the proximal tubule into the bloodstream, respectively. This decreases glucose uptake and enhances the urinary excretion of glucose, which lowers and/or normalizes blood glucose levels. SGLT1 is the primary transporter responsible for glucose absorption from the GI tract. SGLT2, a transport protein exclusively expressed in the proximal renal tubules, mediates approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption from tubular fluid.
