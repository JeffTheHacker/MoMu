(-)-it is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline which is substituted by a 4,5-dimethoxy-3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl group at position 1, a methylenedioxy group at positions 6-7 and a methoxy group at position 8. Obtained from plants of the Papaveraceae family, it lacks significant painkilling properties and is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. It has a role as an antitussive, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and a plant metabolite. It is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, a tertiary amino compound, a cyclic acetal, an isobenzofuranone, an organic heterobicyclic compound, an organic heterotricyclic compound and an aromatic ether. It derives from a (-)-it hemiacetal. it is a phthalide isoquinoline non-narcotic alkaloid derived from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum, with mild analgesic, antitussive, and potential antineoplastic activities. it exerts its antitussive effects through the activation of sigma opioid receptors. This agent appears to exert its antimitotic effect by binding to tubulin, resulting in a disruption of microtubule assembly dynamics and subsequently, the inhibition of mitosis and tumor cell death.
