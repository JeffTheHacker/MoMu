it, also known as 3-mercaptolactate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as monosaccharides. Monosaccharides are compounds containing one carbohydrate unit not glycosidically linked to another such unit, and no set of two or more glycosidically linked carbohydrate units. Monosaccharides have the general formula CnH2nOn. it is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-mercaptolactic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it can be converted into 3-mercaptopyruvic acid through the action of the enzyme L-lactate dehydrogenase. In humans, 3-mercaptolactic acid is involved in the cysteine metabolism pathway and the cystinosis, ocular nonnephropathic pathway. it is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the it-cysteine disulfiduria pathway.
