it is the L-enantiomer of it. It has a role as a thyroid hormone, an antithyroid drug, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a it, an iodophenol, a 2-halophenol, a L-phenylalanine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a synthetic levoisomer of it (T4), similar to the endogenous hormone produced by the thyroid gland. ite is de-iodinated to form triiodothyronine (T3) in the peripheral tissues. T3 enters the cell and binds to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, and the hormone-receptor complex in turn triggers gene expression and produces proteins required in the regulation of cellular respiration, thermogenesis, cellular growth and differentiation, and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. T4 and T3 also possess cardiac stimulatory effect.
