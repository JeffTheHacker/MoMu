Isopimaric acid, also known as it or isopimarate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Isopimaric acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Isopimaric acid has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, isopimaric acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
