it is 7-Chloro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4(3H,5H)-dione in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 1 is substituted by a methyl group, whilst that attached to the other nitrogen is substituted by a phenyl group. It is used for the short-term management of acute anxiety and as an adjunct in the treatment of epilepsy in association with other antiepileptics. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, an anxiolytic drug and a GABA modulator. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepinone and an organochlorine compound. it is a 1,5-benzodiazepine and partial gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, with anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant activities. it binds to a specific site, distinct from the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA binding site, on the benzodiazepine-GABA-A-chloride ionophore receptor complex located in the central nervous system (CNS). This binding causes an allosteric modification of the receptor and enhances the affinity of GABA to the receptor leading to an increase in the opening of chloride-channels. This leads to an increase in chloride ion conductance, neuronal hyperpolarization, inhibition of the action potential and a decrease in neuronal excitability.
