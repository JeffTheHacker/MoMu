Developed by Sanofi-Aventis (formerly Sanofi-Synthelabo), it (SR-142801) is an NK3 receptor antagonist which was under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and other Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. In a review of its R&D portfolio, the company announced in August 2005 that it would cease any further development of it. This follows an earlier decision to discontinue development of eplivanserin for schizophrenia.
