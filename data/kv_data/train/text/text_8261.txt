it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tanshinones, isotanshinones, and derivatives. These are a group of abietane-type norditerpenoid quinones. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, methuyl tanshinonate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, methuyl tanshinonate can be found in alcoholic beverages, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes methuyl tanshinonate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
