2, 6-Dimethyl-1, 4-benzenediol, also known as 2, 6-dimethyl-p-benzohydroquinone or 2, 6-xylohydroquinone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroquinones. Hydroquinones are compounds containing a hydroquinone moiety, which consists of a benzene ring with a hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 4. 2, 6-Dimethyl-1, 4-benzenediol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 6-dimethyl-1, 4-benzenediol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 6-dimethyl-1, 4-benzenediol can be found in common pea and pulses. This makes 2, 6-dimethyl-1, 4-benzenediol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
