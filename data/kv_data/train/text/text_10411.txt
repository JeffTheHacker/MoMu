it, also known as iso-amyl N-decanoate or isoamyl caprate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3-methylbutyl decanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it has a sweet, banana, and cognac taste.
