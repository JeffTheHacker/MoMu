it is the hydrochloride salt of isoxsuprine, a benzyl alcohol derivative with vasodilator activity. The mechanism of action of it is controversial because this drug has beta-adrenergic agonist activities that are not reversed by beta-adrenergic blockers. Although stimulation of the beta adrenergic receptor increases blood flow to produce vasodilatation, this drug may also have direct effects on the contractility of smooth muscle. it also causes relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and may also produce positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the myocardium.
