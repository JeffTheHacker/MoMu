Dimenhydrinate is the diphenhydramine salt of 8-chlorotheophylline. Its effects are similar to those of diphenhydramine, but it is less potent. It was thought that by combining the antiemetic effects of diphenhydramine with the mild stimulant effects of 8-chlorotheophyline, the extreme drowsiness induced by the former would be mitigated. However, the sedation caused by diphenhydramine is considerably stronger than the stimulation caused by 8-chlorotheophylline. Dimenhydrinate is used mainly as an antiemetic in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist and an antiemetic. It contains a diphenhydramine and an 8-chlorotheophylline(1-).
