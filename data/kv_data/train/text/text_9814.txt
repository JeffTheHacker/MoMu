it is a member of the class of imidazoles that it imidazole-2-thione in which a methyl group replaces the hydrogen which is attached to a nitrogen. It has a role as an antithyroid drug. it is a thioamide inhibitor of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO), with antithyroid activity. Upon administration, it inhibits the metabolism of iodide and the iodination of tyrosine residues in the thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin by TPO; this prevents the synthesis of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).
