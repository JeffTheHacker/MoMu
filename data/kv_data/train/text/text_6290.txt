Epigallocatechin 3, 3', -di-O-gallate, also known as 3, 3'-di-O-galloylepigallocatechin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as catechin gallates. These are organic compounds containing a gallate moiety glycosidically linked to a catechin. Epigallocatechin 3, 3', -di-O-gallate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, epigallocatechin 3, 3', -di-O-gallate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, epigallocatechin 3, 3', -di-O-gallate can be found in tea. This makes epigallocatechin 3, 3', -di-O-gallate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
