it is a 5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid that has S configuration. While it is a COX1 and COX2 inhibitor, both enantiomers exhibit analgesic effects. Racemic ketorolac, known simply as ketorolac, is used (mainly as the tromethamine salt) as a potent analgesic for the short-term management of post-operative pain, and in eye drops to relieve the ocular itching associated with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. It has a role as an analgesic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-ketorolac.
