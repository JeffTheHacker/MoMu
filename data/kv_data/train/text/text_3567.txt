it is a hydrochloride that is the monohydrochloride salt of propafenone. It is a class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anesthetic effects, and is used in the management of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It contains a propafenone(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of propafenone with class 1C antiarrhythmic effects. it stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby reducing sodium influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses in Purkinje and myocardial cells. This agent produces a marked depression of phase 0 and prolonged effective refractory period in the atrio-ventricular nodal and His-Purkinje tissue, resulting in a profound decrease in excitability, conduction velocity and automaticity, thereby counteracting atrial and ventricular arrythmias.
