4-Ethyl-1, 2-benzenediol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as catechols. Catechols are compounds containing a 1, 2-benzenediol moiety. 4-Ethyl-1, 2-benzenediol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-ethyl-1, 2-benzenediol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 4-ethyl-1, 2-benzenediol can be found in a number of food items such as coffee, eggplant, green vegetables, and cocoa powder. This makes 4-ethyl-1, 2-benzenediol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
