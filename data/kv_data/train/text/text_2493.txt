it[iso2], also known as 1, 2-dilaurin or 1, 2-didodecanoylglycerol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 2-diacylglycerols. These are diacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at positions 1 and 2. Thus, it[iso2] is considered to be a diradylglycerol lipid molecule. it[iso2] is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it[iso2] is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
