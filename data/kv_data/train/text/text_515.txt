Limonin, also known as evodin or citrolimonin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as limonoids. These are highly oxygenated, modified terpenoids with a prototypical structure either containing or derived from a precursor with a 4, 4, 8-trimethyl-17-furanylsteroid skeleton. All naturally occurring citrus limonoids contain a furan ring attached to the D-ring, at C-17, as well as oxygen containing functional groups at C-3, C-4, C-7, C-16 and C-17. Limonin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, limonin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Limonin is a bitter tasting compound that can be found in citrus, lemon, mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine), and sweet orange. This makes limonin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
