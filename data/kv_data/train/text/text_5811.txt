it is the difumarate salt form of emedastine, a second generation, selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist with anti-allergic activity. Emedastine reversibly and competitively blocks histamine by binding to H1 receptors, thus blocking its downstream activity. As a result, this agent interferes with mediator release from mast cells either by inhibiting calcium ion influx across mast cell/basophil plasma membrane or by inhibiting intracellular calcium ion release within the cells. In addition, emedastine may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction mediated through leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Upon ocular administration, emedastine causes a dose-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva. Emedastine does not affect adrenergic, dopamine, or serotonin receptors.
