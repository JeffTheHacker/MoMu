it, also known as 18:1, N-9 or 9-octadecenoate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains between 13 and 21 carbon atoms. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as blood and urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from octadec-9-ene. it is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, 1-octadec-9-enoylglycero-3-phosphate, N-(2-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-9-octadecenamide, and sterculic acid.
