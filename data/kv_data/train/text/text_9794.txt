Itaconyl-CoA, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Itaconyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Itaconyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, itaconyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, itaconyl-CoA can be found in a number of food items such as brazil nut, pineapple, breadnut tree seed, and romaine lettuce. This makes itaconyl-CoA a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
