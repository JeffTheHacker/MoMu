Dimethyltetrasulfide, also known as 2, 3, 4, 5-tetrathiahexane or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sulfenyl compounds. These are organosulfur compounds a sulfenyl group with the general formula RS (R = organyl). Dimethyltetrasulfide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, dimethyltetrasulfide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Dimethyltetrasulfide exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Dimethyltetrasulfide is a cabbage, garlic, and meaty tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as soft-necked garlic, mushrooms, garden onion, and shiitake. This makes dimethyltetrasulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
