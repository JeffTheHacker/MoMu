it, also known as tomatidenol or purapuridine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as spirosolanes and derivatives. These are steroidal alkaloids with a structure containing a spirosolane skeleton. Siporosolane is a polycyclic compound that is characterized by a 1-oxa-6-azaspiro[4. 5]decane moiety where the oxolane ring is fused to a docosahydronaphth[2, 1:4', 5']indene ring system. Spirosolane arises from the conversion of a cholestane side-chain into a bicyclic system containing a piperidine and a tetrahydrofuran ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, solasodine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, solasodine can be found in a number of food items such as garden onion, common chokecherry, black salsify, and rocket salad (ssp. ). This makes solasodine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
