it is a thyroid hormone receptor isoform beta-1 liver-selective analog with antilipidemic and antiatherosclerotic activity. In animal models it reduced serum lipids, decreased cholesterol levels, and stimulated steps of reverse cholesterol transport, which promotes the reverse transport of cholesterol from atherogenic macrophages back to the liver for excretion. In humans, it lowered plasma LDL cholesterol and reduced plasma triglycerides, while its liver-selective activity helped avoid the side effects seen with many other thyromimetic agents.
