it is a lactam that is 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one in which the hydrogen at position 6 is substituted by a 4-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy group. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a vasodilator agent, a fibrin modulating drug, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, a neuroprotective agent, an anticoagulant and an EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase) inhibitor. It is a member of tetrazoles and a lactam. it is a quinolinone derivative and cellular phosphodiesterase inhibitor, more specific for phosphodiesterase III (PDE III). Although the exact mechanism of action of is unknown, it and its metabolites appears to inhibit PDE III activity, thereby suppressing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) degradation. This results in an increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation.
