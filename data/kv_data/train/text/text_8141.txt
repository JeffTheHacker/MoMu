it is an aza-steroid that is a synthetic drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has a role as an androgen antagonist, an EC 1.3.1.22 [3-oxo-5alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase (NADP(+))] inhibitor and an antihyperplasia drug. It is an aza-steroid, a 3-oxo steroid and a delta-lactam. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-androstane. it is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound. it competitively binds to and inhibits steroid type II 5-alpha-reductase in the prostate gland, liver, and skin, thereby interfering with the enzymatic conversion of testosterone to 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and reducing serum DHT levels. The reduction in serum DHT levels results in diminished stimulation of androgen receptors in the nuclei of prostate cells and, so, diminished prostate cell proliferation.
