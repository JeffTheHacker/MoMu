it, also known as milthanthine or N-methylstepharine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as proaporphines. These are benzylisoquinoline derivatives characterized by the presence of a spirocyclohexane ring that can occur in various oxidation levels, from cyclohexadienone to cyclohexanol it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in cherimoya, coffee and coffee products, poppy, and sacred lotus. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
