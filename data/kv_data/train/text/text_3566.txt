Posaconazole belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpiperazines. Phenylpiperazines are compounds containing a phenylpiperazine skeleton, which consists of a piperazine bound to a phenyl group. Posaconazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Posaconazole has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, posaconazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Posaconazole is a potentially toxic compound.
