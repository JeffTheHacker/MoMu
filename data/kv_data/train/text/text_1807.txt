it is a hydroxycoumarin that is methane in which two hydrogens have each been substituted by a 4-hydroxycoumarin-3-yl group. Related to warfarin, it has been used as an anticoagulant. It has a role as a vitamin K antagonist, an anticoagulant, an EC 1.6.5.2 [NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and a Hsp90 inhibitor. it is a hydroxycoumarin originally isolated from molding sweet-clover hay, with anticoagulant and vitamin K depletion activities. it is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase; thus, it inhibits vitamin K recycling and causes depletion of active vitamin K in blood. This prevents the formation of the active form of prothrombin and several other coagulant enzymes, and inhibits blood clotting.
