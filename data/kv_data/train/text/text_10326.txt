it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Lung Cancer, Drug/Agent Toxicity by Tissue/Organ, and Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific. it is a folate analog antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. As the 6R diastereomer of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, it inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, arresting cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. The agent has been shown to be active against tumors that are resistant to the folate antagonist methotrexate. (NCI04)
