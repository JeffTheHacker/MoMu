Ethyl 1-naphthylacetic acid, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthalenes. Naphthalenes are compounds containing a naphthalene moiety, which consists of two fused benzene rings. Ethyl 1-naphthylacetic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ethyl 1-naphthylacetic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
