it is the meglumine salt form of diatrizoate, an organic, iodinated, radiopaque X-ray contrast medium used in diagnostic radiography. The iodine moiety of it is not penetrable by X-rays, therefore blocks the X-ray film exposure by radiation. This makes it possible to distinguish on X-ray film, body parts that contain it from body parts that do not contain this agent and allows for visualization of different body structures.
