it is an orally bioavailable small-molecule with tubulin-inhibiting, vascular-disrupting, and potential antineoplastic activities. it inhibits tubulin polymerization in tumor blood vessel endothelial cells and tumor cells, blocking the formation of the mitotic spindle and leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase; this may result in disruption of the tumor vasculature and tumor blood flow, and tumor cell death.
