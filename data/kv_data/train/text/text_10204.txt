2-Propanoylthiazole, also known as fema 3611, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl alkyl ketones. These are ketones have the generic structure RC(=O)R', where R = aryl group and R'=alkyl group. 2-Propanoylthiazole is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-propanoylthiazole is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 2-Propanoylthiazole is a bread, cereal, and nutty tasting compound that can be found in fats and oils and green vegetables. This makes 2-propanoylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
