Leucyl-phenylalanine, also known as leu-phe or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. Leucyl-phenylalanine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Leucyl-phenylalanine has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, urine, and blood.
