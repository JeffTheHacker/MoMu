it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl thioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by an aryl group. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-thiocyanatophenol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 4-thiocyanatophenol can be found in fruits. This makes 4-thiocyanatophenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
