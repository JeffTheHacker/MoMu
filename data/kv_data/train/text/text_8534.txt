it is a synthetic homodetic cyclic peptide comprising N(alpha)-(3-sulfanylpropanoyl)homoarginyl, glycyl, aspartyl, tryptophyl, prolyl and cysteinamide residues connected in sequence and cyclised via a disulfide bond. Derived from a protein found in the venom of the southeastern pygmy rattlesnake, Sistrurus miliarus barbouri, it is an anti-coagulant that inhibits platelet aggregation by selectively blocking the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, so preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands. It is used in the management of unstable angina and in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and stenting procedures. It has a role as a platelet aggregation inhibitor and an anticoagulant. It is an organic disulfide, a macrocycle and a homodetic cyclic peptide. it is a cyclical heptapeptide with anticoagulant activity. it selectively and reversibly binds to and blocks the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. This prevents the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands and leads to an inhibition of platelet aggregation and prevents thrombus development.
