Viekira Pak is a combination of oral antiviral agents that is used to treat chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1. This combination has been associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, and has been reported to cause rare cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice and may result in hepatic decompensation in some patients with preexisting cirrhosis. it is an orally bioavailable, synthetic acylsulfonamide inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease complex comprised of non-structural protein 3 and 4A (NS3/NS4A), with potential activity against HCV genotype 1. Upon administration, it reversibly binds to the active center and binding site of the HCV NS3/NS4A protease and prevents NS3/NS4A protease-mediated polyprotein maturation. This disrupts both the processing of viral proteins and the formation of the viral replication complex, which inhibits viral replication in HCV genotype 1-infected host cells. NS3, a serine protease, is essential for the proteolytic cleavage of multiple sites within the HCV polyprotein and plays a key role during HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication. NS4A is an activating factor for NS3. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
