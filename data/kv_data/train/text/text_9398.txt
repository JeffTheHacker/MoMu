it is a synthetic sulfated bis(lactobionic acid amide) derivative and heparin analogue with anticoagulant activity. it is made up of two fully sulfated lactobionic acid moieties with a diamine spacer via two amide bonds. This agent inhibits thrombin by antagonizing heparin cofactor II (HCII) and thus prevents thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. It prolongs clotting time.
