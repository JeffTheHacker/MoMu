it is the acetate salt form of ganirelix, a synthetic decapeptide with high antagonistic activity against naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Ganirelix directly competes with the GnRH for receptor binding in the anterior pituitary gland, thus induces a rapid and reversible suppression of the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This agent is used for the inhibition of premature LH surges in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, and in combination with other hormones for retrieval of the mature follicles for in-vitro fertilization.
