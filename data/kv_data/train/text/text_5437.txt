, also known as gramisterol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ergosterols and derivatives. These are steroids containing ergosta-5, 7, 22-trien-3beta-ol or a derivative thereof, which is based on the 3beta-hydroxylated ergostane skeleton. Thus, is considered to be a sterol lipid molecule. is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. can be biosynthesized from stigmastane.
