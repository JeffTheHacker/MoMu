it solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% it) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of it dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although it is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing. it is an it that consists of a single nitrogen atom covelently bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant and a mouse metabolite. It is an it, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide. it is an inorganic compound composed of a single nitrogen atom covalently bonded to three hydrogen atoms that is an amidase inhibitor and neurotoxin. It is both manufactured and produced naturally from bacterial processes and the breakdown of organic matter. it is used in many industrial processes, and as a fertilizer and refrigerant. It is characterized as a colorless gas or compressed liquid with a pungent odor and exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
