it is a long-chain primary fatty alcohol that is henicosane in which a hydrogen attached to one of the terminal carbons is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Siegesbeckia orientalis and from an Italian bread wheat variety, Pegaso, and its 11 near-isogenic lines. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It derives from a hydride of a henicosane.
