it is a member of the class of triazoles, it is 1,2,4-triazole substituted by a 4-carboxyphenyl group at position 1 and by 2-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 3 and 5. An orally active iron chelator, it is used to manage chronic iron overload in patients receiving long-term blood transfusions. It has a role as an iron chelator. It is a member of triazoles, a monocarboxylic acid, a member of benzoic acids and a member of phenols. It derives from a 2,2'-(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)diphenol. it is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, achiral, tridentate triazole derived from salicylic acid with iron-chelating activity. it chelates iron at a 2:1 (ligand:iron) ratio. Because of its oral availability and long plasma half-life, this agent may be superior to desferrioxamine (desferal, DFO), which is orally inactive and has a short plasma half-life.
