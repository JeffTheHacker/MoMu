(e)-2-it, also known as 2-octen-1-al or (2E)-it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain aldehydes. These are an aldehyde with a chain length containing between 6 and 12 carbon atoms (e)-2-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule (e)-2-it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and urine. Within the cell, (e)-2-octenal is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (e)-2-octenal can be found in black walnut and burdock. This makes (e)-2-octenal a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
