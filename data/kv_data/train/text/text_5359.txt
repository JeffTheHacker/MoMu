1, 2-Dimethoxy-4-vinylbenzene, also known as 3, 4-dimethoxy-styrene or 4-ethenyl-1, 2-dimethoxy-benzene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dimethoxybenzenes. These are organic aromatic compounds containing a monocyclic benzene moiety carrying exactly two methoxy groups. 1, 2-Dimethoxy-4-vinylbenzene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 2-dimethoxy-4-vinylbenzene is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 1, 2-Dimethoxy-4-vinylbenzene is a cortex, floral, and fruity tasting compound that can be found in cereals and cereal products and coffee and coffee products. This makes 1, 2-dimethoxy-4-vinylbenzene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
