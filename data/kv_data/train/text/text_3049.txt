it is a 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetamide that has R configuration at the sulfur atom. Like its racemate, modafinil, it is used for the treatment of sleeping disorders such as narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnoea, and shift-work sleep disorder. Peak concentration in the blood later occurs later following administration than with modafinil, so it is thought that it may be more effective than modafinil in treating people with excessive daytime sleepiness. It has a role as a central nervous system stimulant and a eugeroic. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-modafinil. it is the R-enantiomer of the racemic synthetic agent modafinil with central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and wakefulness-promoting activities. Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, it appears to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine-reuptake pump, which leads to an increase in extracellular dopamine levels in some brain regions. This agent does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and enzymes that may be involved in sleep/wake regulation and is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. it has a longer half-life than modafinil.
