it is a white powder. Exists in two polymorphic forms. (NTP, 1992) it is a 1-ribosyltriazole that is the 1-ribofuranosyl derivative of 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide. A synthetic guanosine analogue, it is an inhibitor of HCV polymerase and possesses a broad spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses. It has a role as an antimetabolite, an antiviral agent, an antiinfective agent, an EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a 1-ribosyltriazole, an aromatic amide and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a synthetic nucleoside analog of ribofuranose with activity against hepatitis C virus and other RNA viruses. it is incorporated into viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, inducing viral genome mutations, and inhibiting normal viral replication.
