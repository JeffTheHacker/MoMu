it is a member of benzimidazoles, a member of pyridines and a sulfoxide. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.10 (H(+)/K(+)-exchanging ATPase) inhibitor and an anti-ulcer drug. it is a substituted benzimidazole prodrug with selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor activity. it prodrug is converted to an active sulfonamide derivative in the acidic environment of the gastric parietal cell; the sulfonamide derivative binds to the gastric proton pump H+/K+ ATPase and forms a stable disulfide bond with the sulfhydryl group near the potassium-binding site on the luminal side, resulting in inactivation of the ATPase and a reduction in gastric acid secretion. This agent does not have anticholinergic or histamine H2 -receptor antagonistic properties.
