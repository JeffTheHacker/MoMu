These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. 2-Propenyl cyclohexanepentanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 2-Propenyl cyclohexanepentanoate has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-propenyl cyclohexanepentanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. 2-Propenyl cyclohexanepentanoate has an apple, apricot, and fruity taste.
