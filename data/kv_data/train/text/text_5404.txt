it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl alkyl ketones. These are ketones have the generic structure RC(=O)R', where R = aryl group and R'=alkyl group it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (R)-athanagrandione is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (R)-athanagrandione can be found in potato. This makes (R)-athanagrandione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
