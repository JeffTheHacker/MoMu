it is the 6-O-methyl ether of erythromycin A, it is a macrolide antibiotic used in the treatment of respiratory-tract, skin and soft-tissue infections. It is also used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. It prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, a protein synthesis inhibitor, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. it is a semisynthetic 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic. it binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits RNA-dependent protein synthesis in susceptible organisms. it has been shown to eradicate gastric MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphomas, presumably due to the eradication of tumorigenic Helicobacter pylori infection. This agent also acts as a biological response modulator, possibly inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth through alterations in growth factor expression. (NCI04)
