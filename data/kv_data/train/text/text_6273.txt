it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 10-hydroxymyoporone is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 10-hydroxymyoporone can be found in root vegetables and sweet potato. This makes 10-hydroxymyoporone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
