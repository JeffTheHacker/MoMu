it, also known as 9:0(3-OH) or tetraethylenepentamine, urea amide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain hydroxy acids and derivatives. These are hydroxy acids with a 6 to 12 carbon atoms long side chain it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in milk and milk products.
