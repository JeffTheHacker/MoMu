it is a third-generation cephalosporin compound having 2-(2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)acetylamino and [(2-methyl-5,6-dioxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)sulfanyl]methyl side-groups. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-lactamase) inhibitor and a drug allergen. It is a cephalosporin, a member of 1,2,4-triazines, a member of 1,3-thiazoles and an oxime O-ether. It is a conjugate acid of a ceftriaxone(1-). it is a beta-lactam, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs participate in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall, and in reshaping the cell wall during cell division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. Compared to the second and first generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is more active against gram-negative bacteria and less active against gram-positive bacteria. it also crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches therapeutic concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS).
