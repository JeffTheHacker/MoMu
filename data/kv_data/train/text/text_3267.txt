it is a fluorinated steroid, a cyclic ketal, a 20-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent, an anti-inflammatory drug and an anti-asthmatic drug. it is a synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory and antiallergic properties. it is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist that binds to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes such as lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both are potent mediators of inflammation.
