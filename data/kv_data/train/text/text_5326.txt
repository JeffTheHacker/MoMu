Methyl (R)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also known as fema 3713 or methyl 2-keto-3-methylvalerate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. Methyl (R)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Methyl (R)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, methyl (R)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
