it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor. Flash point less than 0Â°F. Less dense than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors are heavier than air. it is a six-carbon aromatic annulene in which each carbon atom donates one of its two 2p electrons into a delocalised pi system. A toxic, flammable liquid byproduct of coal distillation, it is used as an industrial solvent. it is a carcinogen that also damages bone marrow and the central nervous system. It has a role as a non-polar solvent, a carcinogenic agent and an environmental contaminant. It is an aromatic annulene, a volatile organic compound and a member of its. it is a clear, colorless, highly flammable and volatile, liquid aromatic hydrocarbon with a gasoline-like odor. it is found in crude oils and as a by-product of oil-refining processes. In industry it is used as a solvent, as a chemical intermediate, and is used in the synthesis of numerous chemicals. Exposure to this substance causes neurological symptoms and affects the bone marrow causing aplastic anemia, excessive bleeding and damage to the immune system. it is a known human carcinogen and is linked to an increased risk of developing lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers, acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
