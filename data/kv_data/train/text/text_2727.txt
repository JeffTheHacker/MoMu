DG(18:0/0:0/18:0), also known as diacylglycerol(36:0) or DAG(36:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3-diacylglycerols. These are diacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at positions 1 and 3. DG(18:0/0:0/18:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. DG(18:0/0:0/18:0) has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, DG(18:0/0:0/18:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
