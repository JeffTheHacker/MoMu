it is an organic nitrate salt, a conazole antifungal drug and an imidazole antifungal drug. it is the nitrate salt form of sulconazole, a synthetic imidazole derivative with antifungal property. it inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation, resulting in the accumulation of fungal 14 alpha-methyl sterols and inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis leads to a disruption of cell membrane permeability, and ultimately inhibition of cell wall synthesis. In addition, it seems to interfere with the autolytic degradation of fungal DNA and RNA.
