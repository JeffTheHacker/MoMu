it is a thioxanthen-9-one compound having a methyl substituent at the 1-position and a 2-[(diethylamino)ethyl]amino substituent at the 4-position. Formerly used for the treatment of schistosomiasis. It is a prodrug, being metabolised to hycanthone. It has a role as a schistosomicide drug, an antineoplastic agent, a photosensitizing agent, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor, a prodrug, an adjuvant and a mutagen. it is an orally available thioxanthone-based DNA intercalator and inhibitor of the DNA repair enzyme apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APEX1 or APE1), with anti-schistosomal and potential antineoplastic activity. it intercalates DNA and interferes with the activity of topoisomerases I and II during replication and transcription, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of macromolecules. In addition, this agent specifically inhibits the endonuclease activity of APE1, without affecting its redox activity, resulting in un-repaired DNA strand breaks which may induce apoptosis. Therefore, it may sensitize tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Furthermore, it inhibits autophagy through the disruption of lysosomal function. The multifunctional nuclease APE1 is a key component for DNA repair; its expression is often correlated with tumor cell resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.
