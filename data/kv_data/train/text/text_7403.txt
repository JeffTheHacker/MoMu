2-Naphthalenol 2-aminobenzoate, also known as it or 2-aminobenzoyl 2-naphthalenol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthalenes. Naphthalenes are compounds containing a naphthalene moiety, which consists of two fused benzene rings. 2-Naphthalenol 2-aminobenzoate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-naphthalenol 2-aminobenzoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-Naphthalenol 2-aminobenzoate has a floral, grape, and neroli taste.
