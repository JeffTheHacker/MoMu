it is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which a hydrogen attached to one of the nitrogens is replaced by a 2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl group, while the hydrogens attached to the other nitrogen are replaced by a methyl group and a 6-{[4-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl group. It is a potent and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor. It has a role as a fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonist and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aminopyrimidine, a N-arylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, a dichlorobenzene and a member of phenylureas. it is an orally bioavailable pan inhibitor of human fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. it selectively binds to and inhibits the activities of FGFRs, which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, and the induction of tumor cell death. FGFRs are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which may be upregulated in various tumor cell types and may be involved in tumor cell differentiation and proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.
