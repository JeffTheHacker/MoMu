Teniposide is a furonaphthodioxole that is a synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with anti-tumour activity; causes single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA and DNA-protein cross-links and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor. It is a furonaphthodioxole, a gamma-lactone, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of thiophenes, an aromatic ether, a member of phenols and a cyclic acetal. It derives from a podophyllotoxin. Teniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with antineoplastic activity. Teniposide forms a ternary complex with the enzyme topoisomerase II and DNA, resulting in dose-dependent single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA, DNA: protein cross-links, inhibition of DNA strand religation, and cytotoxicity. This agent acts in the late S or early G phase of the cell cycle. (NCI04)
