it is a pyrimidine that is a derivative of cytosine, having a methyl group at the 5-position. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a member of pyrimidines and a methylcytosine. It derives from a cytosine. it is a methylated form of the nucleobase cytosine occurring predominantly in cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands that are produced by DNA methyltransferases and may regulate gene expression. Like cytosine, the DNA sequence containing it (5-mC) is able to be replicated without error and 5-mC can pair with guanine in double stranded DNA. However, DNA sequences containing a high local concentration of 5-mC may be less transcriptionally active than areas with higher ratios of unmodified cytosine.
