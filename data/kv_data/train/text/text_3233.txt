it appears as odorless white crystalline powder or free-flowing granules. Sweet taste. (NTP, 1992) it is the D-enantiomer of it. It has a role as an osmotic diuretic, a sweetening agent, an antiglaucoma drug, a metabolite, an allergen, a hapten, a food bulking agent, a food anticaking agent, a food humectant, a food stabiliser, a food thickening agent, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a member of compatible osmolytes. it is a naturally occurring alcohol found in fruits and vegetables and used as an osmotic diuretic. it is freely filtered by the glomerulus and poorly reabsorbed from the renal tubule, thereby causing an increase in osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate. An increase in osmolarity limits tubular reabsorption of water and inhibits the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes, thereby promoting diuresis. In addition, it elevates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues into interstitial fluid and plasma.
