it is a potassium salt having clavulanate as the counterion. It acts as a suicide inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes and has only weak anitbiotic activity when administered alone. However it can be used in combination with amoxicillin trihydrate (under the trade name Augmentin) for treatment of a variety of bacterial infections, where it prevents antibiotic inactivation by microbial lactamases. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-lactamase) inhibitor and an antimicrobial agent. It contains a clavulanate. it is a semi-synthetic beta-lactamase inhibitor isolated from streptomyces. Clavunalate potassium contains a beta-lactam ring and binds strongly to beta-lactamase at or near its active site. This protects other beta-lactam antibiotics from beta-lactamase catalysis. This drug is used in conjunction with beta-lactamase susceptible penicillins to treat infections caused by beta-lactamase producing organisms.
