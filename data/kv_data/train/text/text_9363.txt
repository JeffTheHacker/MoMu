it is the methobromide salt of the N,N'-bis[3-(dimethylamino)phenyl carbamate] derivative of 2,13-diazatetradecane. It is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase, with a long duration of action. It is used in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma: in the eye, it causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle, facilitating the outflow of the aqueous humor and so reducing intraocular pressure. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a quaternary ammonium salt, a bromide salt and a carbamate ester. It contains a demarcarium. it is the bromide salt form of demecarium, a quaternary ammonium compound and a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor with parasympathomimetic activity. When used topically, demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase, thereby preventing acetylcholine breakdown and increasing acetylcholine activity. This causes contraction of the iris sphincter muscle (producing miosis) and the ciliary muscle (affecting the accommodation reflex). In so doing, this agent increases the outflow of the aqueous humor, thereby reducing intraocular pressure.
