it is a vinca alkaloid, a methyl ester, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a tertiary alcohol, a tertiary amino compound and a primary carboxamide. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It derives from a vincaleukoblastine. it is a synthetic derivative of vinblastine, a naturally occurring vinca alkaloid. it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby interrupting tubulin polymerization and preventing the formation of the mitotic spindle and cell division; treated cells are unable to undergo mitosis and are arrested in metaphase. This agent also disrupts macromolecular synthesis. (NCI04) it Sulfate is the sulfate salt form of it. it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby interrupting tubulin polymerization and preventing the formation of the mitotic spindle and cell division; treated cells are unable to undergo mitosis and are arrested in metaphase. This agent also disrupts macromolecular synthesis. (NCI)
