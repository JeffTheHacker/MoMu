it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1-hydroxy-2-unsubstituted benzenoids. These are phenols that are unsubstituted at the 2-position. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]benzamide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]benzamide can be found in pomes. This makes N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]benzamide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
