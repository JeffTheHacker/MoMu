Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as [cimetidine] and [famotidine]. This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion. Ranitidine is often referred to as Zantac, and is available in various forms, including tablet, injection, and effervescent tablet preparations.  The prevalence of GERD is thought to be 10-20% in western countries. Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions. Ranitidine is a member of the class of histamine H2-receptor antagonists with antacid activity. Ranitidine is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine, released by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, at the histamine H2-receptors on parietal cells in the stomach, thereby inhibiting the normal and meal-stimulated secretion of stomach acid. In addition, other substances that promote acid secretion have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.
