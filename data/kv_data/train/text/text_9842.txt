it is a member of the class of phenothiazines that is 10H-phenothiazine having a chloro substituent at the 2-position and a 3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl group at the N-10 position. It has a role as an antiemetic, a dopaminergic antagonist, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, a cholinergic antagonist, a first generation antipsychotic, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor and a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist. It is an organochlorine compound, a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-methylpiperazine and a member of phenothiazines. It derives from a hydride of a 10H-phenothiazine. it is a synthetic propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine with antiemetic, antipsychotic, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic activities. it antagonizes the dopamine D2-receptor in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain and may prevent chemotherapy-induced emesis.
