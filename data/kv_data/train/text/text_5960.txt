Protodioscin, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. Protodioscin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Protodioscin has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, protodioscin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, protodioscin can be found in common beet and green vegetables. This makes protodioscin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
