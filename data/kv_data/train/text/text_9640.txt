it is an N-[2-methoxy-5-({[2-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl]sulfonyl}methyl)phenyl]glycine in which the double bond has E-configuration. It is a non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of PLK1 with an IC50 of 9 nM and exhibits anti-cancer properties. It has a role as a microtubule-destabilising agent, an EC 2.7.11.21 (polo kinase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a synthetic benzyl styryl sulfone analogue and Ras mimetic, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it targets and binds to Ras-binding domain (RBD) found in many Ras effector proteins, including Raf kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). This prevents Ras from binding to its targets and inhibits Ras-mediated signaling pathways, including Ras/Raf/Erk, Ras/CRAF/polo-like kinase1 (Plk1), and Ras/ PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in a variety of susceptible tumor cells.
