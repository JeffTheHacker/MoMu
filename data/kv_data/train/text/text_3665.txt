it is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-[(2-methylhydrazino)methyl]benzoic acid with the amino group of isopropylamine. An antineoplastic chemotherapy drug used for treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Metabolism yields azo-it and hydrogen peroxide, which results in the breaking of DNA strands. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of hydrazines and a member of benzamides. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic activities. Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated, it, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation, resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through an alkylation reaction.
