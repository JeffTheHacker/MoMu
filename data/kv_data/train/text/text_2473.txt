(3beta, 5alpha, 6beta, 24R)-Stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol, also known as 5-alpha-stigmastane-3beta-5, 6beta-triol-3-monobenzoate or (3Î², 5Î±, 6Î², 24R)-stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stigmastanes and derivatives. These are sterol lipids with a structure based on the stigmastane skeleton, which consists of a cholestane moiety bearing an ethyl group at the carbon atom C24. Thus, (3beta, 5alpha, 6beta, 24R)-stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol is considered to be a sterol lipid molecule (3beta, 5alpha, 6beta, 24R)-Stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral (3beta, 5alpha, 6beta, 24R)-Stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (3beta, 5alpha, 6beta, 24R)-stigmastane-3, 5, 6-triol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
