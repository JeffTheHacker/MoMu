it, also known as GAR, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as its. its are compounds in which the amide N atom of glycineamide is linked to the C-1 of a ribosyl (or deoxyribosyl) moiety. Nucleotides have a phosphate group linked to the C5 carbon of the ribose (or deoxyribose) moiety. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, glycineamideribotide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from 5-phosphoribosylamine and glycine; which is mediated by the enzyme trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3. In addition, 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate and glycineamideribotide can be converted into tetrahydrofolic acid and 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide; which is catalyzed by the enzyme trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3. In humans, glycineamideribotide is involved in the purine metabolism pathway, the thioguanine action pathway, the azathioprine action pathway, and the mercaptopurine action pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include xanthine dehydrogenase deficiency (xanthinuria), the xanthinuria type II pathway, the AICA-ribosiduria pathway, and the xanthinuria type I pathway.
