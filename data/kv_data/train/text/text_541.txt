it is a 4-ethylthio-3-methylpyridine analogue of omeprazole with no substituent on the benzimidazole ring, with selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor activity. Once converted to its active sulfenamide form, it forms a stable disulfide bond with the sulfhydryl group of the hydrogen-potassium (H+/K+) ATPase found on the secretory surface of parietal cells, thereby inhibiting the final transport of hydrogen ions (via exchange with potassium ions) into the gastric lumen and suppressing gastric acid secretion.
