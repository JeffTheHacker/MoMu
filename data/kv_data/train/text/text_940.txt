it is an acyclic it. It has a role as an iron chelator and a siderophore. It is a conjugate acid of a it B(3-). it is an iron-chelating agent that binds free iron in a stable complex, preventing it from engaging in chemical reactions. it chelates iron from intra-lysosomal ferritin and siderin forming ferrioxamine, a water-soluble chelate excreted by the kidneys and in the feces via the bile. This agent does not readily bind iron from transferrin, hemoglobin, myoglobin or cytochrome. (NCI04)
