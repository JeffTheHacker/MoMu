it is a 17-oxo steroid that is estra-1,3,5(10)-triene substituted by an hydroxy group at position 3 and an oxo group at position 17. It has a role as an estrogen, a bone density conservation agent, an antineoplastic agent, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 3-hydroxy steroid and a 17-oxo steroid. It derives from a hydride of an estrane. Therapeutic it is the synthetic form of a naturally occurring estrogen it. it diffuses through the cell membrane and binds to and subsequently activates the nuclear estrogen receptor found in the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, liver, and bone. The activated hormone-receptor complex gets translocated to the nucleus where it binds to the estrogen response element on the DNA and promotes the transcription of target genes involved in the functioning of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. it increases the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins, as well as suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary.
