it is a (1E)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)pent-1-en-3-ol that has S configuration at the chiral centre. It is the enantiomer of (R)-uniconazole; the fungicide and plant growth retardant uniconazole is the racemic mixture comprising (R)-uniconazole and it. It has a role as a plant growth retardant, an antifungal agrochemical and an EC 1.14.13.78 (ent-kaurene oxidase) inhibitor. It is a (1E)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)pent-1-en-3-ol, a conazole fungicide and a triazole fungicide. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-uniconazole.
