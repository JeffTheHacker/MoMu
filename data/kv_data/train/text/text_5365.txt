it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glutamine and derivatives. Glutamine and derivatives are compounds containing glutamine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of glutamine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, L-N-(3-carboxypropyl)glutamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, L-N-(3-carboxypropyl)glutamine can be found in root vegetables. This makes L-N-(3-carboxypropyl)glutamine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
