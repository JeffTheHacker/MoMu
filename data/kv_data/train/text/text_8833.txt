4-[(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)azo]benzenesulfonic acid, also known as c. i. 14270 or c. i. acid orange 6, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as azobenzenes. These are organonitrogen aromatic compounds that contain a central azo group, where each nitrogen atom is conjugated to a benzene ring. 4-[(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)azo]benzenesulfonic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-[(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)azo]benzenesulfonic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
