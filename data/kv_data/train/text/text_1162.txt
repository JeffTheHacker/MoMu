9-alpha, 10-alpha-Epoxyhexahydrocannabinol, also known as aatth or ehhc, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 2-dimethyl-1-benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a 1-benzopyran moiety that carries two methyl groups at the 2-position. 9-alpha, 10-alpha-Epoxyhexahydrocannabinol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 9-alpha, 10-alpha-Epoxyhexahydrocannabinol has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 9-alpha, 10-alpha-epoxyhexahydrocannabinol is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
