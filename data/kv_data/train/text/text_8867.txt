it is a nucleotide conjugate that is used in combination with ledipasvir (under the trade name Harvoni) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. It has a role as a prodrug, an antiviral drug and a hepatitis C protease inhibitor. It is a L-alanyl ester, a phosphoramidate ester, a nucleotide conjugate, an organofluorine compound and an isopropyl ester. It derives from a uridine 5'-monophosphate. it is an orally available nucleotide prodrug and a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitor with potential HCV inhibiting activity. Upon oral administration, sofosbuvir is metabolized to 2'-deoxy-2'-alpha-fluoro-beta-C-methyluridine-5'-monophosphate, which is then converted into the active triphosphate nucleotide that inhibits the NS5B polymerase, thereby preventing viral replication. The HCV NS5B protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the replication of the viral HCV RNA genome.
