it is a urea that is the N-carbamoyl derivative of L-glutamic acid. An orphan drug used to treat a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase, which leads to acute hyperammonaemia. It has a role as an orphan drug and a carbamylphosphate synthetase I activator. It is a N-acyl-L-glutamic acid and a member of ureas. it is an orally active, synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1) activator, with ammonia lowering activity. NAG, which is formed by the hepatic enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), is an essential allosteric activator of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1). CPS 1 plays an essential role in the urea cycle and converts ammonia into urea. Upon oral administration, it can replace NAG in NAGS deficient patients and activates CPS 1, which prevents hyperammonaemia.
