it is an N-alkylpiperazine carrying (4-chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methyl and 4-tert-butylbenzyl groups. It has a role as an antiemetic, a cholinergic antagonist, a histamine antagonist, a local anaesthetic and a central nervous system depressant. It is a N-alkylpiperazine and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is a conjugate base of a it(2+). it is a piperazine histamine H1 receptor antagonist with primarily antiemetic and antivertigo activities. it binds to and blocks the histamine H1 receptor, thereby preventing the symptoms that are caused by histamine activity. it exerts its anti-emetic effect by binding to and blocking the muscarinic and histamine receptors in the vomiting center of the central nervous system (CNS). This may prevent activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and may reduce nausea and vomiting.
