Glycerophosphocholine, also known as choline alfoscerate or GPC, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glycerophosphocholines. These are lipids containing a glycerol moiety carrying a phosphocholine at the 3-position. Glycerophosphocholine exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Glycerophosphocholine has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including semen, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and feces. Within the cell, glycerophosphocholine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Glycerophosphocholine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Glycerophosphocholine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Glycerophosphocholine can be biosynthesized from 11-cis-retinol and PC(24:1(15Z)/15:0); which is mediated by the enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase. In addition, Retinyl ester and glycerophosphocholine can be biosynthesized from vitamin a and PC(24:1(15Z)/15:0); which is mediated by the enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase. In humans, glycerophosphocholine is involved in the retinol metabolism pathway. Glycerophosphocholine is also involved in the metabolic disorder called vitamin a deficiency.
