it appears as yellow crystals or canary yellow powder with a faint to moderate sulfide odor. (NTP, 1992) it is a thiocarboxamide that is pyridine-4-carbothioamide substituted by an ethyl group at position 2. A prodrug that undergoes metabolic activation by conversion to the corresponding S-oxide. It has a role as an antitubercular agent, an antilipemic drug, a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, a leprostatic drug and a prodrug. It is a member of pyridines and a thiocarboxamide. it is a nicotinamide derivative, with antibacterial activity, used to treat tuberculosis. Although the exact mechanism of action of it is unknown, it may inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acid, a saturated fatty acid found in the bacterial cell wall, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. This eventually leads to bacterial cell wall disruption and cell lysis. it may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug at the site of infection and the susceptibility of the organism involved.
