Methyl 3-oxo-12-oleanen-28-Oate, also known as it or 1-tosylpiperidine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Methyl 3-oxo-12-oleanen-28-Oate exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, methyl 3-oxo-12-oleanen-28-Oate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, methyl 3-oxo-12-oleanen-28-Oate can be found in fruits and nuts. This makes methyl 3-oxo-12-oleanen-28-Oate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
