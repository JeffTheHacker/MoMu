Obtusifoliol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Obtusifoliol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, obtusifoliol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Obtusifoliol exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, obtusifoliol can be found in a number of food items such as mamey sapote, cloudberry, grapefruit, and bilberry. This makes obtusifoliol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
