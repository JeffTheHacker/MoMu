it is a synthetic metallotexaphyrin with radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties. it accumulates in tumor cells preferentially due to their increased rates of metabolism, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) intracellularly and lowering the tumor cell apoptotic threshold to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.
