it is a dipeptide. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It contains a L-prolino group and a L-lysine residue. it Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of the long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor it with antihypertensive activity. it, a synthetic peptide derivative, competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and results in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
