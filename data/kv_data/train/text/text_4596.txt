Ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. Ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside can be found in pulses. This makes ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
