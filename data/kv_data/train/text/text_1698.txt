it is a biflavonoid that is obtained by oxidative coupling of two molecules of apigenin resulting in a bond between positions C-8 of the two chromene rings respectively. Isolated from Cupressus sempervirens and Juniperus occidentalis, it exhibits free radical scavenging and antielastase activities. It has a role as an EC 3.4.21.37 (leukocyte elastase) inhibitor, a radical scavenger and a metabolite. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavone and a ring assembly.
