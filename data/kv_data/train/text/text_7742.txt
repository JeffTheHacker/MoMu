it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Prostate Cancer, Testicular Germ Cell Tumor, and Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific. it is a disaccharide analogue of the anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic doxorubicin. it intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. This agent also induces apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism. it is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin.
