2-Methyl-4-phenyl-2-butyl 2-methylpropanoate, also known as dimethyl(phenylethyl)carbinyl isobutyrate or 1, 1-dimethyl-3-phenylpropyl isobutyrate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzene and substituted derivatives. These are aromatic compounds containing one monocyclic ring system consisting of benzene. 2-Methyl-4-phenyl-2-butyl 2-methylpropanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-methyl-4-phenyl-2-butyl 2-methylpropanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-Methyl-4-phenyl-2-butyl 2-methylpropanoate has a sweet, floral, and fruity taste.
