it is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by methyl groups at positions 6 and 8, hydroxy groups at positions 5, 2' and 5' and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 7. Isolated from the leaves of Myrcia multiflora, it exhibits inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase and aldose reductase. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor and an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a trihydroxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside, a beta-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative.
