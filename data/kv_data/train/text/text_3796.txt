it is the pamoate salt of triptorelin, a synthetic decapeptide agonist analog of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). Possessing greater potency than endogenous LHRH, triptorelin reversibly represses gonadotropin secretion after prolonged administration. After chronic, continuous administration, a sustained decrease in LH, FSH and testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis is observed. The serum testosterone concentration may fall to levels typically seen in surgically castrated men. (NCI04)
