UTP is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate having uracil as the nucleobase. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate and a uridine 5'-phosphate. It is a conjugate acid of an UTP(4-) and an UTP(3-). INS316 is a short-acting, aerosolized uridine 5-triphosphate (UTP) solution used as a diagnostic aid for lung cancer. INS316 appears to improve sputum expectoration mediated through the P2Y2 receptor, a nucleotide receptor expressed in human airway epithelial cells and some other tissues. UTP binding to the P2Y2 receptor triggers signal transduction that leads to chloride ion secretion, thereby resulting in mucociliary clearance of airway.
