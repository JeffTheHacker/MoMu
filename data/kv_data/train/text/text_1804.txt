Atropine is a natural alkaloid anticholinergic agent that has potent antimuscarinic effects and is used by injection to treat symptomatic bradycardia, severe bronchospasm and to reduce vagal stimulation. Atropine has not been implicated in causing liver enzyme elevations or clinically apparent acute liver injury. Homatropine is a synthetic tertiary amine alkaloid with antimuscarinic properties. Homatropine, a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor, blocks parasympathetic nerve stimulation.
