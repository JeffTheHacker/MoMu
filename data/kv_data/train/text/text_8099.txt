(R,R)-it is a hydrochloride resulting from the reaction of (R,R)-tramadol with 1 molar equivalent of hydrogen chloride; the (R,R)-enantiomer of the racemic opioid analgesic it, it exhibits ten-fold higher analgesic potency than the (S,S)-enantiomer. It has a role as a delta-opioid receptor agonist, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an antitussive, a capsaicin receptor antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a nicotinic antagonist, a NMDA receptor antagonist, an opioid analgesic, a serotonergic antagonist and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. It contains a (R,R)-tramadol(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (S,S)-it. it is a synthetic codeine analogue, it has central analgesic properties with effects similar to opioids, such as morphine and codeine, acting on specific opioid receptors. The hydrochloride salt of Tramadol and used as a narcotic analgesic for severe pain, it can be addictive and weakly inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. (NCI04)
