it, also known as it or phenethylidene-malononitrile, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anisoles. These are organic compounds containing a methoxybenzene or a derivative thereof. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1-(isothiocyanatomethyl)-4-methoxybenzene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 1-(isothiocyanatomethyl)-4-methoxybenzene can be found in green vegetables. This makes 1-(isothiocyanatomethyl)-4-methoxybenzene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
