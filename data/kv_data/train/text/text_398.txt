it is a D-tryptophan derivative obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of D-tryptophan with the amino group of (quinoxalin-6-yl)methylidenehydrazide. It directly targets the Rho GEF binding domain, thereby preventing Rho from interacting with its GEFs It has a role as a RhoA inhibitor, a RhoC inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a D-tryptophan derivative, a quinoxaline derivative and a hydrazone.
