it is a phosphinic acid-containing N-acyl derivative of (4S)-cyclohexyl-L-proline. An inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), it is used as the phosphinate ester pro-drug fosinopril for treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It is a member of phosphinic acids and a L-proline derivative. it is a phosphinic acid-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it specifically and competitively inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme thereby decreasing the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, resulting in diminished vasopressor activity. In addition, angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion by adrenal cortex is decreased, which results in a decrease of sodium retention and an increase in water outflow.
