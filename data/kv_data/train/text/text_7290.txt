Methylselenol, also known as methaneselenol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as selenols. These are organic compounds that contains the functional group with the connectivity R-Se-H. Methylselenol exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Methylselenol participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Methylselenol and 2-ketobutyric acid can be biosynthesized from selenomethionine through the action of the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase CYS3. In addition, Methylselenol can be biosynthesized from methylselenic acid through the action of the enzyme thioredoxin reductase.
