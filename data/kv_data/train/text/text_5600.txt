it is a pentacyclic triterpenoid obtained by the formal condensation of 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid with the 3-hydroxy group of betulinic acid. It is isolated from the Chinese herb Syzygium claviflorum. The first in the class of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors to be studied in humans, it was identified as a potent HIV drug candidate and several clinical trials were conducted, but development into a new drug was plagued by numerous resistance-related problems. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV-1 maturation inhibitor. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a betulinic acid. it is a drug derived from a betulinic acid-like compound, first isolated from the Chinese herb Syzygium claviflorum, with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). it acts by binding to the Gag capsid precursor protein and blocking its conversion to mature capsid protein by protease cleavage. It potently inhibits replication in both wild-type and drug-resistant (reverse transciptase or protease) HIV-1 isolates.
