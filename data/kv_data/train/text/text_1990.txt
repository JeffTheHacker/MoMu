it appears as a white crystalline solid. Forms very flammable mixtures with combustible materials. Mixtures may be ignited by friction and may be explosive if the combustible material is finely divided. Contact with concentrated sulfuric acid solutions may cause fires or explosions. May spontaneously decompose and ignite when mixed with ammonium salt. May explode under prolonged exposure to heat or fire. Used in explosives and pyrotechnics, in dyeing textiles, and to make other chlorates.
