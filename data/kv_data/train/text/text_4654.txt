it, also known as 10, 14-epoxyaromadendrane or mezotrin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 5, 10-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids. These are aromadendrane sesquiterpenoids that arise from the C5-C10 cyclization of the aromadendrane skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
