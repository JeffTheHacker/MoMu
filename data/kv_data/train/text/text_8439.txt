it has been used in trials studying the supportive care of Nausea and Vomiting and Testicular Germ Cell Tumor. it is the hydrochloride salt of a 2-piperazinylbenzimidazole-derivative serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist with antiemetic activity. it specifically binds to 5-HT3 receptors, located peripherally on vagus nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the area postrema, which may result in suppression of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
