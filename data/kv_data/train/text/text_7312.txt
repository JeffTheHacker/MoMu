it is a quinazoline that is 7-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methoxy]quinazoline bearing additional methoxy and 4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino substituents at positions 6 and 4 respectively. Used for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. It has a role as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aromatic ether, a secondary amine, a member of quinazolines, a member of piperidines, an organobromine compound and an organofluorine compound. it is an orally bioavailable 4-anilinoquinazoline. it selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), thereby blocking VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and migration and reducing tumor vessel permeability. This agent also blocks the tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates tumor cell proliferation and migration and angiogenesis.
