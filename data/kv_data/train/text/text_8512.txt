(S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain fatty acyl coas. These are acyl CoAs where the group acylated to the coenzyme A moiety is a long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms (S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa) (S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway (S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include trifunctional protein deficiency, long-chain-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (lchad), the glutaric aciduria type I pathway, and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (lcad).
