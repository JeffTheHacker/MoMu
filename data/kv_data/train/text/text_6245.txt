it is an aminoglycoside sulfate salt resulting from the treatment of paromomycin with sulfuric acid. A broad-spectrum antibiotic, it is used for the treatment of acute and chronic intestinal protozoal infections, but is not effective for extraintestinal protozoal infections. It is also used as a therapeutic against visceral leishmaniasis. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an antiprotozoal drug, an anthelminthic drug and an antiparasitic agent. It derives from a paromomycin. it is the sulfate salt form of paromomycin, a structural derivative of neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic with amebicidal and bactericidal effects against predominantly aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Paromomycin binds specifically to the RNA oligonucleotide at the A site of bacterial 30S ribosomes, thereby causing misreading and premature termination of translation of mRNA and inhibition of protein synthesis followed by cell death.
