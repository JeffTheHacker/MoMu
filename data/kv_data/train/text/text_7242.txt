it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 8alpha-3-copaen-8-ol is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 8alpha-3-copaen-8-ol can be found in fats and oils, green vegetables, and herbs and spices. This makes 8alpha-3-copaen-8-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
