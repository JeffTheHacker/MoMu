it is a bromide salt consisting of two bromide ions and one pancuronium dication. It has a role as a muscle relaxant, a cholinergic antagonist and a nicotinic antagonist. It contains a pancuronium. it is the bromide salt form of pancuronium, a synthetic, long-acting ammonio steroid muscle relaxant with curarimimetic, some antimuscarinic and sympathomimetic effects. it competitively binds to the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing acetylcholine binding and resulting in skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis.
