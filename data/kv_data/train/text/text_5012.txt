it, also known as astraisoflavan, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 4'-o-methylated isoflavonoids. These are isoflavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C4' atom of the isoflavonoid backbone. Isoflavonoids are natural products derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as yellow wax bean, herbs and spices, green bean, and tea. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
