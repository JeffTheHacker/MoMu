it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trifluoromethylbenzenes. These are organofluorine compounds that contain a benzene ring substituted with one or more trifluoromethyl groups. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). it and formaldehyde can be biosynthesized from fluoxetine through its interaction with the enzymes cytochrome P450 3A5, cytochrome P450 3A4, cytochrome P450 2C9, cytochrome P450 2C19, and cytochrome P450 2D6. In humans, it is involved in the fluoxetine metabolism pathway and the fluoxetine action pathway.
