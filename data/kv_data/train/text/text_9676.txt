it is a thiocarboxamide consiting of acetamide having the oxygen replaced by sulfur. It has a role as a hepatotoxic agent. It derives from an acetamide. it is a synthetic, colorless crystalline solid that is soluble in water and ethanol. it is currently only used as a replacement for hydrogen sulfide in qualitative analysis. When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The primary routes of potential human exposure to it are inhalation and dermal contact. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
