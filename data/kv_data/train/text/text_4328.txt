3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA, also known as it , belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3-oxo-acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a 3-oxo acylated coenzyme A derivative. 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3-oxohexanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, 3-oxohexanoyl-CoA is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway. 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the glutaric aciduria type I pathway, long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (lcad), short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (scad deficiency), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency (I).
