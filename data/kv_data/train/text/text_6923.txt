it is an azaspiro compound that is 8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione substituted at the nitrogen atom by a 4-(piperazin-1-yl)butyl group which in turn is substituted by a pyrimidin-2-yl group at the N(4) position. It has a role as an anxiolytic drug, a sedative, a serotonergic agonist and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is an azaspiro compound, a member of pyrimidines, a N-arylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, a member of piperidones and an organic heteropolycyclic compound. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an anxiolytic agent chemically and pharmacologically unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other sedative/hypnotic drugs. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it may exert its anti-anxiety effects via serotonin (5-HT1A) and dopamine receptors (D2) and may indirectly affect other neurotransmitter systems. Unlike typical benzodiazepine anxiolytics, this agent does not exert anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant effects and lacks prominent sedative effects.
