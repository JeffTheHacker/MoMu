it is a piperidinecarboxylate ester that is piperidine which is substituted by a methyl group at position 1 and by phenyl and ethoxycarbonyl groups at position 4. It is an analgesic which is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and labour pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is an ethyl ester, a piperidinecarboxylate ester and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a ite(1+). it is a synthetic piperidine ester with opioid analgesic activity. it mimics the actions of endogenous neuropeptides via opioid receptors, thereby producing the characteristic morphine-like effects on the mu-opioid receptor, including analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, miosis, bradycardia and physical dependence.
