it, also known as fema 3302, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxypyrazines. These are pyrazines containing a methoxyl group attached to the pyrazine ring. it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, methoxypyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a sweet, cocoa, and nutty tasting compound that can be found in cocoa and cocoa products. This makes methoxypyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
