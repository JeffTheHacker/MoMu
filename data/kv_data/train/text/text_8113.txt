it (anhydrous) is guanine substituted at the 9 position by a 4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylidenecyclopentyl group. A synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, it is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with selective antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus. it is phosphorylated intracellularly to the active triphosphate form, which competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate, the natural substrate of hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase, inhibiting every stage of the enzyme's activity, although it has no activity against HIV. It is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. It has a role as an EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor and an antiviral drug. It is a member of 2-aminopurines, an oxopurine, a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol. it Anhydrous is an anhydrous formulation of it, a synthetic analog of 2-deoxyguanosine with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). it is activated in vivo to a 5-triphosphate metabolite. In turn, the triphosphate form competes with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) for incorporation into viral DNA. The incorporation of the activated triphosphate metabolite of it inhibits the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral RNA-dependent HBV DNA polymerase and, so, the replication of viral DNA and transcription.
