4-hydroxyacetanilide is an odorless white crystalline solid. Bitter taste. pH (saturated aqueous solution) about 6. (NTP, 1992) it is a member of the class of phenols that is 4-aminophenol in which one of the hydrogens attached to the amino group has been replaced by an acetyl group. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, an antipyretic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 3 inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a human blood serum metabolite and a hepatotoxic agent. It is a member of phenols and a member of acetamides. It derives from a 4-aminophenol. it is a p-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic activities. Although the exact mechanism through which it exert its effects has yet to be fully determined, it may inhibit the nitric oxide (NO) pathway mediated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and substance P, resulting in elevation of the pain threshold. The antipyretic activity may result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and release in the central nervous system (CNS) and prostaglandin-mediated effects on the heat-regulating center in the anterior hypothalamus.
