4-Methoxybenzyl butanoate, also known as it or fema 2100, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group. 4-Methoxybenzyl butanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-methoxybenzyl butanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4-Methoxybenzyl butanoate has a sweet, anisic, and buttery taste.
