Valencene, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eremophilane, 8, 9-secoeremophilane and furoeremophilane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based either on the eremophilane skeleton, its 8, 9-seco derivative, or the furoeremophilane skeleton. Eremophilanes have been shown to be derived from eudesmanes by migration of the methyl group at C-10 to C-5. Valencene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, valencene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, valencene can be found in burdock. This makes valencene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
