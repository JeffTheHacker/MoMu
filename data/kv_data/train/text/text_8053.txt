N-Deschlorobenzoyl indomethacin, also known as DBI or 5-methoxy-methylindoleacetic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indole-3-acetic acid derivatives. Indole-3-acetic acid derivatives are compounds containing an acetic acid (or a derivative) linked to the C3 carbon atom of an indole. N-Deschlorobenzoyl indomethacin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. N-Deschlorobenzoyl indomethacin has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood.
