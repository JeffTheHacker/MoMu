1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-b-carboline-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as harmala alkaloids. Harmala alkaloids are compounds with a structure based on harmaline, harmine, harmalol, harman or a derivative of those parents. These parents are beta-carbolines, consisting of a pyrimidine fused to the pyrrole moiety of an indole to form a pyrido[3, 4-b]indole. 1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-b-carboline-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-b-carboline-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-b-carboline-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-b-carboline-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
