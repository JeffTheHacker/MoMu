1, 2, 4, 5, 7-Pentathiocane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as organic disulfides. These are organosulfur compounds with the general formula RSSR' (R, R' = alkyl, aryl). 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-Pentathiocane exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-pentathiocane is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-pentathiocane can be found in green vegetables, mushrooms, and pulses. This makes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-pentathiocane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
