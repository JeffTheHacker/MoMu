it is the potassium salt of oxonate, an enzyme inhibitor that modulates 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity. it inhibits orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of 5-FU to its active or phosphorylated form, FUMP. Upon oral administration, Oxonate is selectively distributed to the intracellular sites of tissues lining the small intestines, producing localized inhibitory effects within the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, 5-FU associated gastrointestinal toxic effects are reduced and the incidence of diarrhea or mucositis is decreased in 5-FU related therapy.
