it is an N-glycosylpyrrolopyrimidine that is adenosine in which the in the 5-membered ring that is not attached to the ribose moiety is replaced by a carbon. it is produced in the culture broth of Streptomyces tubericidus. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and an antimetabolite. It is a N-glycosylpyrrolopyrimidine, a ribonucleoside and an antibiotic antifungal agent. it is an antibiotic and adenosine analog isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces tubercidicus with potential antineoplastic activity. it is incorporated into DNA and inhibits polymerases, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and RNA and protein synthesis. This agent also exhibits antifungal and antiviral activities. (NCI04)
