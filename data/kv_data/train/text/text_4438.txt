it anhydrous is cytosine substituted at the 1 position by a 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl group (S configuration). A nucleoside analogue, it is an injectable antiviral used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. It has a role as an antiviral drug, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-HIV agent and a photosensitizing agent. It is a pyrimidone and a member of phosphonic acids. It is a conjugate acid of a it(2-) and a it(1-). it Anhydrous is an anhydrous form of it, a synthetic, acyclic monophosphate nucleotide analog of deoxycytidine with antiviral activity, mostly used against cytomegalovirus (CMV). After incorporation into the host cell, it is phosphorylated by pyruvate kinases to its active metabolite it diphosphate. it diphosphate, bearing structural similarity to nucleotides, competes with deoxycytosine-5-triphosphate (dCTP) for viral DNA polymerase and gets incorporated into the growing viral DNA strands. As a result, it prevents further DNA polymerization and disrupts DNA replication of viruses.
