it is a semisynthetic penicillin having a 6beta-{(2R)-2-[(2-oxoimidazolidine-1-carbonyl)amino]-2-phenylacetyl}amino side-group. It is an antibiotic used in treating infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a penicillin, a semisynthetic derivative and a penicillin allergen. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is a semisynthetic, extended spectrum acylampicillin with antibacterial activity. it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, thereby inhibiting the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, which are critical components of the bacterial cell wall. This prevents proper bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and eventually leading to cell lysis.
