it is the choline salt form of [theophylline]. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Its main physiological reponse is to dilate the bronchioles. As such, oxytriphylline is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD (i.e. all the same indications as the other theophyllines). It is marketed under the name Choledyl SA, and several forms of oxytriphylline have been discontinued. In the US, it is no longer available. it is the choline salt of theophylline with an anti-asthmatic property. it appears to inhibit phosphodiesterase and prostaglandin production, regulates calcium flux and intracellular calcium distribution, and antagonizes adenosine. Physiologically, this agent causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, produces vasodilation (except in cerebral vessels), stimulates cardiac muscle, as well as induces diuresis and gastric acid secretion. It may also suppress inflammation and improve contractility of the diaphragm.
