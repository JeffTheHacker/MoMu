Abietinol, also known as abietyl alcohol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Abietinol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, abietinol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
