it is a dipeptide formed from L-alanyl and L-glutamine residues. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a tautomer of an it zwitterion. Alanylglutamine is a nutritional supplement containing a stable, water-soluble dipeptide comprised of the amino acids L-glutamine and L-alanine, with potential protective and absorption enhancing activities. Upon oral or enteral administration, alanylglutamine works locally in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to both protect the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and maintain intestinal barrier functions. This reduces bacterial translocation, the risk of infection, infection-induced inflammatory damage and infection-associated symptoms, such as diarrhea, dehydration, malabsorption and electrolyte imbalances. Alanylglutamine also increases absorption of other chemicals, enhances epithelial repair, and inhibits apoptosis due to cellular damage, and stimulates cellular proliferation. Altogether, this improves absorption of nutrients, decreases weight loss, reduces diarrhea, decreases the risk of GI-associated infections and improves recovery. Upon absorption, alanylglutamine may also help inhibit muscle protein catabolism.
