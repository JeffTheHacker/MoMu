it is an oxime O-ether resulting from the formal conversion ot the acyclic keto group of 5-[2-(ethylsulfanyl)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-propionylcyclohex-2-en-1-one to the corresponding oxime with subsequent O-alkylation of the oxime by an (E)-3-chloroallyl group. It is used as a itive postemergence herbicide for the control of annual and perennial grasses in numerous crops, including alfalfa, celery, clover, conifers, cotton, cranberries, garlic, onions, ornamentals, peanuts, soybeans, strawberries, sugarbeet, sunflowers, and vegetables; the (-)-enantiomer has been reported to be more active than the (+)-enantiomer. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 6.4.1.2 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) inhibitor. It is an organic sulfide, a cyclic ketone, an organochlorine compound, an oxime O-ether, a beta-diketone and an enol.
