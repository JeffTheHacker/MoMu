209 chlorinated diphenyl oxides existed when all possible isomers are counted. The chemical formulas of these substances range from C12H9OCl to C12OCl10. The compounds are generally waxy solids or liquids, but appearance, odor and other properties vary. The compound hexachlorodiphenyl oxide C12H4OCl6 is taken to represent this group by OHSA (http://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_226400.html)  Used in the manufacture of flame-inhibiting polymers, as corrosion inhibitors, dry-cleaning detergents, thermal lubricants, additives for soaps and lotions, and in the manufacture of hydraulic fluids, pesticides, wood preservatives, and electric insulators.
