it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, p-hydroxynonanophenone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, p-hydroxynonanophenone can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes p-hydroxynonanophenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
