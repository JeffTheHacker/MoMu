11, 12, 13-Trinor-1, 3, 5-bisabolatrien-10-Oic acid, also known as 4-p-tolylpentanoic acid or dihydro-a-norcurcumenic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aromatic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. 11, 12, 13-Trinor-1, 3, 5-bisabolatrien-10-Oic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 11, 12, 13-trinor-1, 3, 5-bisabolatrien-10-Oic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
