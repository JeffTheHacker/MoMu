it is a glycoside that is the alpha-L-rhamnosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-glucoside of hydroxytyrosol in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the glucopyranosyl moiety has undergone esterification by formal condensation with trans-caffeic acid. It has a role as a neuroprotective agent, an antileishmanial agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a plant metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It is a cinnamate ester, a disaccharide derivative, a member of catechols, a polyphenol and a glycoside. It derives from a hydroxytyrosol and a trans-caffeic acid.
