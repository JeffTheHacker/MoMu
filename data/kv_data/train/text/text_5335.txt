it is a chelated octreotide derivative with somatostatin activity. it is produced by substituting tyrosine for phenylalanine at the 3 position of octreotide and chelated via dodecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA). Like octreotide, this it binds to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), especially type 2, present on the cell membrane of many types of neuroendocrine tumors. When labeled with nuclides, it conjugates could result in tissue specific cytotoxicity.
