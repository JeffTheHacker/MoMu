it appears as a colorless to brown colored liquid. Combustible but may require some effort to ignite. it is a triol with a structure of propane substituted at positions 1, 2 and 3 by hydroxy groups. It has a role as an osmolyte, a solvent, a detergent, a human metabolite, an algal metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an alditol and a triol. it is a trihydroxyalcohol with localized osmotic diuretic and laxative effects. it elevates the blood plasma osmolality thereby extracting water from tissues into interstitial fluid and plasma. This agent also prevents water reabsorption in the proximal tubule in the kidney leading to an increase in water and sodium excretion and a reduction in blood volume. Administered rectally, it exerts a hyperosmotic laxative effect by attracting water into the rectum, thereby relieving constipation. In addition, it is used as a solvent, humectant and vehicle in various pharmaceutical preparations.
