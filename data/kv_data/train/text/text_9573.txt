it is a triglyceride obtained by formal acylation of the three hydroxy groups of glycerol by capric (decanoic) acid. It is a triglyceride and a decanoate ester. it is an orally available precursor of decanoic acid (DA), a 10-carbon fatty acid and major component of medium chain triglyceride oils, with potential antiandrogen and antihyperglycemic properties. Upon oral administration, it is hydrolyzed to DA, which binds to and partially activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, as well as PPAR-alpha and PPAR-beta/delta, without inducing adipogenesis. Additionally, it may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease androgen production.
