it, also known as animal starch or liver starch, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and myelin sheath. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from amylose; which is catalyzed by the enzyme 1, 4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme. In addition, it can be biosynthesized from Alpha-D-glucose; which is catalyzed by the enzyme maltase-glucoamylase, intestinal. In humans, it is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the itosis, type iii. cori disease, debrancher itosis pathway, the itosis, type vi. hers disease pathway, sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, and the itosis, type iv. amylopectinosis, anderson disease pathway.
