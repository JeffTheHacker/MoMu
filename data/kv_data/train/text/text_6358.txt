it is a tetrol that is cyclohexene in which a hydrogen attached to each of the carbons at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 is replaced by a hydroxy group. The group consists of six possible diastereoisomers, known as its A to F, some of which can exist as two distinct enantiomers. It is a tetrol, a secondary alcohol and a cyclitol. It derives from a hydride of a cyclohexene.
