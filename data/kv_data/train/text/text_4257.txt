it is a hydralazine and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor with antidepressant activity. it blocks the breakdown (oxidative deamination) of biogenic amines by inhibiting MAO, thereby increasing the concentrations of norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytrytamine (5-HT) at central aminergic receptors. These neurotransmitters are involved in sustaining mood and emotions. The down-regulation of central beta-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors by chronic inhibition of MAO may also contribute to the antidepressant effects seen by it. (NCI05)
