N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine, also known as epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine or trimethyllysine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as l-alpha-amino acids. These are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine has been found in human testicle tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, N6, N6, N6-trimethyl-L-lysine is primarily located in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine and S-adenosylhomocysteine can be biosynthesized from L-lysine and S-adenosylmethionine; which is mediated by the enzyme histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7. In addition, N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine and oxoglutaric acid can be converted into 3-hydroxy-N6, N6, N6-trimethyl-L-lysine and succinic acid through its interaction with the enzyme trimethyllysine dioxygenase, mitochondrial. In humans, N6, N6, N6-trimethyl-L-lysine is involved in carnitine synthesis pathway.
