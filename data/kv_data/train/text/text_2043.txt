it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cycloartanols and derivatives. These are steroids containing a cycloartanol moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3beta-24-methylenecycloartan-3-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
