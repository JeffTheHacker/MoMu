Soyasapogenol b belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Soyasapogenol b exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, soyasapogenol b is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, soyasapogenol b can be found in a number of food items such as tea, alfalfa, pulses, and yellow wax bean. This makes soyasapogenol b a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
