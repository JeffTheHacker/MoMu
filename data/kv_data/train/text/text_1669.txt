it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as depsipeptides. These are natural or synthetic compounds having sequences of amino and hydroxy carboxylic acid residues (usually Î±-amino and Î±-hydroxy acids), commonly but not necessarily regularly alternating. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the perindopril action pathway.
