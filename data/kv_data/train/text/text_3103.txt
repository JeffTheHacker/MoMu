Beta-Cadinene, also known as it or cadina-3, 9-diene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Beta-Cadinene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Beta-Cadinene has been primarily detected in saliva. Within the cell, Beta-cadinene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Beta-Cadinene is a green and woody tasting compound that can be found in common oregano, common thyme, ginger, and sweet basil. This makes Beta-cadinene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
