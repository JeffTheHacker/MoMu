it is a topical corticosteroid and prednisolone acetate derivative, with anti-inflammatory activity. Upon instillation into the eye, it binds to and activates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The receptor-ligand complex binds to promoter regions of certain genes and initiates RNA transcription. This results in an induction of synthesis of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of arachidonic acid and preventing the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This reduces ocular inflammation and pain.
