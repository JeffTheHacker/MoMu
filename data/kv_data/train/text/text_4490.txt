it is an odorless white crystalline powder. Melting point 160Â°C, then rapidly polymerizes to a white solid. Almost immediate degradation at pH 3.0; rapid degradation at pH 5.0; and very little degradation at pH 7.5. (NTP, 1992) it is a member of 1,3,5-triazines. It has a role as an insect sterilant and an alkylating agent. it is a trisaziridine alkylating agent with antineoplastic and carcinogenic properties. Used to induce cancer in experimental animal models, it ethylates DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication, unscheduled DNA synthesis, chromosomal aberrations, and sister chromatid exchanges. This agent also exhibits reproductive toxicities. (NCI04)
