it is a phospholipid consisting of 1,1-dimethylpiperidinium-4-yl hydrogen phosphate in which the hydrogen is replaced by a stearyl (octadecyl) group. It has a role as an EC 2.7.1.137 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitor. It is a phospholipid and an ammonium betaine. It derives from an octadecan-1-ol. it is an orally active alkyl-phosphocholine compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Targeting cellular membranes, it modulates membrane permeability, membrane lipid composition, phospholipid metabolism, and mitogenic signal transduction, resulting in cell differentiation and inhibition of cell growth. This agent also inhibits the anti-apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and modulates the balance between the MAPK and pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis. it has a lower gastrointestinal toxicity profile than the related agent miltefosine.
