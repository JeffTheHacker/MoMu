5-Hydroxymethyl-4-methyluracil, also known as it or 4-methyl-5-hydroxymethyluracil, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrimidones. Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. 5-Hydroxymethyl-4-methyluracil is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-hydroxymethyl-4-methyluracil is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
