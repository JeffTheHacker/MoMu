it is an isoxazole (1,2-oxazole) compound having a methyl substituent at the 5-position and a 4-aminobenzenesulfonamido group at the 3-position. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, an antiinfective agent, an epitope, an EC 2.5.1.15 (dihydropteroate synthase) inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent, a P450 inhibitor, an EC 1.1.1.153 [sepiapterin reductase (L-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin forming)] inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a sulfonamide, a member of isoxazoles, a substituted aniline and a sulfonamide antibiotic. It derives from a sulfanilamide. it is a sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic that is most commonly used in combination with trimethoprim as the drug Bactrim. it competitively inhibits dihydropteroate synthase preventing the formation of dihydropteroic acid, a precursor of folic acid which is required for bacterial growth.
