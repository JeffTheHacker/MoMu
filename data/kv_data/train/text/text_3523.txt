it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzylisoquinolines. These are organic compounds containing an isoquinoline to which a benzyl group is attached. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, neferine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, neferine can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes neferine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
