Pantothenol, also known as it or bepanthen, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl amines. N-acyl amines are compounds containing a fatty acid moiety linked to an amine group through an ester linkage. Pantothenol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Pantothenol has been found in human epidermis tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as saliva and urine. Within the cell, pantothenol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, pantothenol is involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway.
