it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, p-menth-3-en-1-ol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, p-menth-3-en-1-ol can be found in a number of food items such as tea, citrus, cocoa and cocoa products, and alcoholic beverages. This makes p-menth-3-en-1-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
