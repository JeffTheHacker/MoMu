it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02626026 (Safety and Pharmacokinetics of GS-4059 in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)). it is an orally available formulation containing an inhibitor of Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it covalently binds to BTK within B cells, thereby preventing B cell receptor signaling and impeding B cell development. As a result, this agent may inhibit the proliferation of B cell malignancies. BTK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and member of the Tec family of kinases, plays an important role in B lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.
