it is a phosphonic acid having an (R,S)-1,2-epoxypropyl group attached to phosphorus. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent and an EC 2.5.1.7 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) inhibitor. It is an epoxide and a member of phosphonic acids. It derives from a phosphonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonate(1-). it is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue and a synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic with antimicrobial and bactericidal properties. it binds to and inactivates the enzyme enolpyruvate transferase. This leads to an irreversible blockage of the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, which is one of the first steps of bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby eventually causing cell lysis and bacterial cell death.
