it is a 19-membered macrocyle that is geldanamycin in which the methoxy group attached to the benzoquinone moiety has been replaced by a 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylamino group. It has a role as a Hsp90 inhibitor. It is a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound, an ansamycin, a member of 1,4-benzoquinones and a carbamate ester. It derives from a geldanamycin. it is an analogue of the antineoplastic benzoquinone antibiotic geldanamycin. it binds to HSP90, a chaperone protein that aids in the assembly, maturation and folding of proteins. Subsequently, the function of Hsp90 is inhibited, leading to the degradation and depletion of its client proteins such as kinases and transcription factors involved with cell cycle regulation and signal transduction.
