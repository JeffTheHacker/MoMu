4, 5-Dimethyl-2-propylthiazole, also known as 2-propyl-4, 5-dimethyi-thiazole, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles. 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted thiazoles are compounds containing a thiazole ring substituted at positions 2, 4 and 5 only. 4, 5-Dimethyl-2-propylthiazole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-propylthiazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4, 5-Dimethyl-2-propylthiazole exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, 4, 5-dimethyl-2-propylthiazole can be found in mushrooms. This makes 4, 5-dimethyl-2-propylthiazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
