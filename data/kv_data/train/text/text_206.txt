it, also known as b-hydroxypalmitoyl-coenzyme A or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain fatty acyl coas. These are acyl CoAs where the group acylated to the coenzyme A moiety is a long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa) it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency (I), trifunctional protein deficiency, the mitochondrial Beta-oxidation OF long chain saturated fatty acids pathway, and the glutaric aciduria type I pathway.
