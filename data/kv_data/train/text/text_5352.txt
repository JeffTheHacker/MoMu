it is a macrocycle that is a lactam analogue of epothilone B. Binds directly to beta-tubulin subunits on microtubules, leading to suppression of microtubule dynamics. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-destabilising agent. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a beta-hydroxy ketone, a lactam, a macrocycle and an epoxide. it is an orally bioavailable semisynthetic analogue of epothilone B with antineoplastic activity. it binds to tubulin and promotes tubulin polymerization and microtubule stabilization, thereby arresting cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and inducing tumor cell apoptosis. This agent demonstrates antineoplastic activity against taxane-resistant cell lines.
