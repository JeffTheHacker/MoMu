Pentazocine is a synthetic opioid with both agonist and antagonist activity against opiate receptors which is used in oral and parenteral forms as an analgesic for moderate-to-severe pain. Pentazocine has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to clinically apparent liver injury.
