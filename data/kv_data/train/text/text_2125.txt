Oxyacanthine, also known as N-methylsepeerine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lignans, neolignans and related compounds. These are plant products of low molecular weight formed primarily from oxidative coupling of two p-propylphenol moieties. They can also be described as micromolecules with two phenylpropanoid units coupled together. They can be attached in various manners, like C5-C5', C8-C8'. Most known natural lignans are oxidized at C9 and C9Â´ and, based upon the way in which oxygen is incorporated into the skeleton and on the cyclization patterns, a wide range of lignans of very different structural types can be formed. Oxyacanthine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, oxyacanthine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Oxyacanthine is a bitter tasting compound that can be found in fruits and tea. This makes oxyacanthine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
