it is a dibenzoazepine consisting of 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine substituted on nitrogen with a 3-(methylamino)propyl group. It has a role as an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, a serotonin uptake inhibitor, a cholinergic antagonist, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, a H1-receptor antagonist, an EC 3.1.4.12 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor, an antidepressant and a drug allergen. It is a dibenzoazepine and a secondary amino compound. it is an active metabolite of imipramine, a tertiary amine and a synthetic tricyclic derivative of the antidepressant. it enhances monoamine neurotransmission in certain areas of the brain by inhibiting the re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin at the noradrenergic and serotoninergic nerve endings, respectively. It also induces sedation through histamine 1 receptor blockage and hypotension through beta-adrenergic blockage.
