17-beta-Estradiol-3, 17-beta-sulfate, also known as 17-b-estradiol-3, 17-b-sulfuric acid or e2-3S-17S, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sulfated steroids. These are sterol lipids containing a sulfate group attached to the steroid skeleton. 17-beta-Estradiol-3, 17-beta-sulfate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 17-beta-Estradiol-3, 17-beta-sulfate has been found in human hepatic tissue, liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 17-beta-estradiol-3, 17-beta-sulfate is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
