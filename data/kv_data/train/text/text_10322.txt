D-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the beta carbon atom. D-it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, D-4'-phosphopantothenate is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. D-it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. D-it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, D-it can be biosynthesized from pantothenic acid through the action of the enzyme pantothenate kinase 1. Furthermore, Cytidine triphosphate, D-4'-phosphopantothenate, and L-cysteine can be converted into cytidine monophosphate and 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase. Furthermore, D-it can be biosynthesized from pantothenic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. Furthermore, D-it, cytidine triphosphate, and L-cysteine can be converted into cytidine monophosphate and 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine through its interaction with the enzyme phosphopantothenate-cysteine ligase. Furthermore, D-it can be biosynthesized from pantothenic acid through the action of the enzyme pantothenate kinase. Finally, D-it, cytidine triphosphate, and L-cysteine can be converted into cytidine monophosphate and 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine through the action of the enzyme phosphopantothenate-cysteine ligase. In humans, D-4'-phosphopantothenate is involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway.
