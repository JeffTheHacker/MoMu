it is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a tetrahydrofuranol and a member of quinazolines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antihypertensive agent and an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. it is a synthetic quinazoline compound with smooth muscle relaxing activity. it selectively binds to and antagonizes alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate, thereby relaxing the smooth muscle and decreasing the obstruction and urethral resistance seen with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. This agent also blocks alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in peripheral vascular smooth muscle, which leads to vasodilatation and a subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.
