it, also known as fema 3162, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, furfuryl thioacetate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a burnt, coffee, and nutty tasting compound that can be found in coffee and coffee products and fats and oils. This makes furfuryl thioacetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
