it is tetracycline in which the hydroxy group at position 5 and the methyl group at position 6 are replaced by hydrogen, and with a dimethylamino substituent and an (N-tert-butylglycyl)amino substituent at positions 7 and 9, respectively. A glycylcycline antibiotic, it has activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including tetracycline-resistant organisms. It is used for the intravenous treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible organisms. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a member of tetracyclines and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic derived from tetracycline. it binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby interfering with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the incorporation of amino acid residues into the elongating peptide chain, inhibiting protein synthesis and eventually bacterial cell growth.
