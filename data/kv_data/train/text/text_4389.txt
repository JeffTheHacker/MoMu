it has been used in trials studying the other, basic science, and treatment of Pain Crisis, Renal impairment, Anemia, Sickle Cell, Sickle Cell Disease, and Sickle Cell Disorders, among others. it is a synthetic, glycomimetic molecule and pan-selectin antagonist, with potential use in a vaso-occlusive crisis. Upon administration, it prevents the interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium and may prevent cell activation and adhesion. By preventing selectin-mediated cell adhesion in sickle cell anemia, this agent may inhibit red blood cell-white blood cell interactions, normalize blood flow and reduce inflammation and vascular occlusive pain. it has the strongest antagonistic activity towards E-selectin but a sulfate-binding domain allows for interactions with P- and L-selectins. Selectins, containing lectin- and EGF-like domains, are a family of cell adhesion molecules implicated in inflammatory processes and cancer.
