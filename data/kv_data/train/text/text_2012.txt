Xi-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as secondary alcohols. Secondary alcohols are compounds containing a secondary alcohol functional group, with the general structure HOC(R)(R') (R, R'=alkyl, aryl). Xi-it is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in cereals and cereal products, citrus, and fruits. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
