5, 7alpha-Dihydro-1, 4, 4, 7a-tetramethyl-4H-indene, also known as 2, 2, 6, 7-tetramethylbicyclo[4. 3. 0]nona-1(9), 4, 7-triene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched unsaturated hydrocarbons. These are hydrocarbons that contains one or more unsaturated carbon atoms, and an aliphatic branch. 5, 7alpha-Dihydro-1, 4, 4, 7a-tetramethyl-4H-indene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 5, 7alpha-dihydro-1, 4, 4, 7a-tetramethyl-4H-indene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 5, 7alpha-dihydro-1, 4, 4, 7a-tetramethyl-4H-indene can be found in fruits and quince. This makes 5, 7alpha-dihydro-1, 4, 4, 7a-tetramethyl-4H-indene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
