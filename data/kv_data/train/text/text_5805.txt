5-Hexyldihydro-5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone, also known as 4-hydroxy-4-methyldecanoic acid lactone or 4-methyl-4-decanolide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. 5-Hexyldihydro-5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 5-hexyldihydro-5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 5-Hexyldihydro-5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone has a coconut, fresh, and jasmin taste.
