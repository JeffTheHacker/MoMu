it, also known as 15-ohcpa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gluco/mineralocorticoids, progestogins and derivatives. These are steroids with a structure based on a hydroxylated prostane moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human hepatic tissue, liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 15beta-hydroxycyproterone acetate is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
