it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02658825 (A Study to Evaluate the Effect of JNJ-63623872 on Cardiac Repolarization Interval in Healthy Participants). it is an orally bioavailable non-nucleoside inhibitor of the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) subunit of the influenza A virus polymerase complex with potential antiviral activity. Upon administration, it occupies the 7-methyl GTP (m7GTP) binding site of PB2, thereby blocking the cap-snatching activity of the influenza polymerase complex and inhibiting the synthesis of viral mRNA. PB2 is one of three subunits that make up the influenza A viral polymerase complex, which is responsible for replication and transcription of the viral RNA (vRNA) genome in the nuclei of infected cells.
