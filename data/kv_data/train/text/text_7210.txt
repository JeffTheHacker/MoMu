it is an oxopurine that is guanine substituted by a (2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl substituent at position 9. Used in the treatment of viral infections. It has a role as an antiviral drug and an antimetabolite. It is an oxopurine and a member of 2-aminopurines. It derives from a guanine. it is a synthetic analog of the purine nucleoside, guanosine, with potent antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus and other viruses of the herpesvirus family. After conversion in vivo to the active metabolite it triphosphate by viral thymidine kinase, it competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase by incorporating into the growing viral DNA chain and terminating further polymerization.
