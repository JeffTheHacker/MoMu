it is a benzenedicarboxamide compound having N-substituted carbamoyl groups at the 1- and 3-positions, iodo substituents at the 2-, 4- and 6-positions and a 3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propanimido at position 5. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a radioopaque medium. It is an organoiodine compound, a hexol and a benzenedicarboxamide. it is a water-soluble, tri-iodinated, non-ionic monomeric benzoate derivative and contrast medium used in diagnostic radiography. Upon administration, it is distributed through the vascular system and interstitial space. Like other organic iodine compounds, this agent blocks x-rays and appears opaque on x-ray film thus, enhancing the visibility of body parts containing this agent. it is rapidly removed by the kidneys in an unchanged form, and in cases of renal failure, heterotropic excretion occurs via the biliary route.
