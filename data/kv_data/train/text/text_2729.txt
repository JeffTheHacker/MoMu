Phenethyl isoamyl ether, also known as 2-phenylethanol or 3-methylbutyl ether, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzene and substituted derivatives. These are aromatic compounds containing one monocyclic ring system consisting of benzene. Phenethyl isoamyl ether is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, phenethyl isoamyl ether is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Phenethyl isoamyl ether has a cool, fresh, and green taste.
