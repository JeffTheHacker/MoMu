it is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is propanoic acid with an amino group at position 2 and a sulfanyl group at position 3. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is an alpha-amino acid, a polar amino acid and a sulfur-containing amino acid. It contains a sulfanylmethyl group. It is a conjugate base of a cysteinium. It is a conjugate acid of a cysteinate(1-). It is a tautomer of a cysteine zwitterion. it is a non-essential sulfur-containing amino acid in humans, related to cystine, it is important for protein synthesis, detoxification, and diverse metabolic functions. Found in beta-keratin, the main protein in nails, skin, and hair, it is important in collagen production, as well as skin elasticity and texture. Also required in the manufacture of amino acid taurine, it is a component of the antioxidant glutathione, and plays a role in the metabolism of essential biochemicals such as coenzyme A, heparin, and biotin.
