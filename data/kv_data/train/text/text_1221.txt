it is a methyl phenyl(piperidin-2-yl)acetate in which both stereocentres have R configuration. It is the active enantiomer in the racemic drug methylphenidate. It has a role as an adrenergic agent. It is an enantiomer of a methyl (S)-phenyl[(S)-piperidin-2-yl]acetate. it is the d-threo-enantiomer of methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant, appearing to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron, increasing their availability in the extracellular space. The mechanism of action in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is unknown. (NCI)
