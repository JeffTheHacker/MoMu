it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Solid Tumors, Ovarian Cancer, Gastric Cancer, Prostate Cancer, and Acute Leukaemia, among others. it is an inhibitor of the kinesin-related motor protein Eg5 with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits the activity of Eg5, which may result in mitotic disruption, apoptosis and consequently cell death in tumor cells that are actively dividing. The ATP-dependent Eg5 kinesin-related motor protein (also known as KIF11 or kinesin spindle protein-5) is a plus-end directed kinesin motor protein that plays an essential role during mitosis, particularly in the regulation of spindle dynamics, including assembly and maintenance.
