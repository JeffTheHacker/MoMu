it is a meroterpenoid resulting from the formal condensation of the hydroxy group of fumagillol with the carboxylic acid group of (all-E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraenedioic acid. Originally isolated from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, it is used for the control of Nosema infection in honey bees. It has a role as an angiogenesis inhibitor, an antibacterial drug, an antiprotozoal drug, a methionine aminopeptidase 2 inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent and a fungal metabolite. It is an organooxygen heterocyclic antibiotic, a meroterpenoid, a carboxylic ester, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, an antibiotic antifungal drug and a spiro-epoxide. It derives from a fumagillol and an (all-E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraenedioic acid.
