N-Arachidonoyl glycine, also known as nagly or ema-1 20:4, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl-alpha amino acids. N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. Thus, N-arachidonoyl glycine is considered to be a fatty amide lipid molecule. N-Arachidonoyl glycine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. N-Arachidonoyl glycine has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, N-arachidonoyl glycine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). N-Arachidonoyl glycine can be biosynthesized from arachidonic acid.
