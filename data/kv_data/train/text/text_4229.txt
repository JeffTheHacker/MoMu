1-{2-[(7-chloro-1-benzothiophen-3-yl)methoxy]-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl}imidazole is a member of the class of imidazoles that carries a 2-[(7-chloro-1-benzothiophen-3-yl)methoxy]-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl group at position 1. It is a dichlorobenzene, an ether, a member of imidazoles and a member of 1-benzothiophenes. it is a synthetic imidazole derivative, containing a benzothiophene ring, with antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic activity. Besides its ability to inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, the benzothiophene ring of it is able to insert into the fungal cell wall instead of tryptophan. This increases the permeability of the cell wall. In addition, it suppresses the release of cytokines.
