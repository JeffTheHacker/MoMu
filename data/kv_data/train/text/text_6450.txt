it is a member of the class of 1-benzofurans that is 1-benzofuran substituted by a butyl group at position 2 and a 4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodobenzoyl group at position 3. It is a cardiovascular drug used for the treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias. It has a role as a cardiovascular drug. It is a member of 1-benzofurans, an organoiodine compound, an aromatic ketone and a tertiary amino compound. it is an iodine-rich benzofuran derivative with antiarrhythmic and vasodilatory activities. As a class III antiarrhythmic agent, it blocks the myocardial calcium, potassium and sodium channels in cardiac tissue, resulting in prolongation of the cardiac action potential and refractory period. In addition, this agent inhibits alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, resulting in a reduction in sympathetic stimulation of the heart, a negative chronotropic effect, and a decrease in myocardial oxygen demands. it may cause vasodilation by stimulation of the release of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-dependent relaxing endothelial factors.
