Ranitidine Bismuth Citrate is a member of the class of histamine H2-receptor antagonists with antacid activity. Ranitidine is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine, released by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, at the histamine H2-receptors on parietal cells in the stomach, thereby inhibiting the normal and meal-stimulated secretion of stomach acid. In addition, other substances that promote acid secretion have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.
