it is a cycloit consisting of the cyclic disulfide of (2Z)-2-aminobut-2-enoyl, L-valyl, (3S,4E)-3-hydroxy-7-sulfanylhept-4-enoyl, D-valyl and D-cysteinyl residues coupled in sequence and cyclised head-to tail. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor. It is a cycloit, an organic disulfide and a heterocyclic antibiotic. it is a bicyclic it antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum with antineoplastic activity. After intracellular activation, it binds to and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), resulting in alterations in gene expression and the induction of cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. This agent also inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and depletes several heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-dependent oncoproteins.
