N-Desalkyl delavirdine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridinylpiperazines. Pyridinylpiperazines are compounds containing a pyridinylpiperazine skeleton, which consists of a pyridine linked (not fused) to a piperazine by a bond by a single bond that is not part of a ring. N-Desalkyl delavirdine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. N-Desalkyl delavirdine has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, N-desalkyl delavirdine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
