Telbivudine is a nucleoside analogue and antiviral inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication which is used alone and in combination with other agents in the therapy of the hepatitis B. Telbivudine does not appear to be a significant cause of drug induced liver injury, but can be associated with flares of the underlying hepatitis B either during therapy or upon withdrawal.
