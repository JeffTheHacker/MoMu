Small white crystals or white powder. Softens at 226Â°F. Odorless. (NTP, 1992) it is a chloroalkene. It has a role as an estrogen receptor modulator, an antineoplastic agent and a xenoestrogen. It derives from a hydride of a stilbene. it is an orally bioavailable, highly lipophilic, synthetic triphenylethylene (TPE) derivative and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with predominantly estrogenic but also antiestrogenic activities. Upon administration, it binds to estrogen receptors (ER) and, depending on the responsive target cells, either activates or blocks ER activity. This modulates the expression of ER-responsive genes in a tissue-specific manner. This agent may increase bone mineral density, modify the lipid profile and ameliorate vasomotor symptoms. it inhibits the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism.
