4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide is a retinoid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of all-trans retinoic acid and the anilino group of 4-hydroxyaniline. Synthetic retinoid agonist. Antiproliferative, antioxidant and anticancer agent with a long half-life in vivo. Apoptotic effects appear to be mediated by a mechanism distinct from that of 'classical' retinoids. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antioxidant. It is a retinoid and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from an all-trans-retinoic acid. it is an orally-active synthetic phenylretinamide analogue of retinol (vitamin A) with potential antineoplastic and chemopreventive activities. it binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis in some tumor cell types. This agent also inhibits tumor growth by modulating angiogenesis-associated growth factors and their receptors and exhibits retinoid receptor-independent apoptotic properties. (NCI04)
