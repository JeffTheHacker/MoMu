it is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 5,5-dimethyl-8-(quinolin-3-yl)-5,6-dihydronaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid with the amino group of p-aminobenzoic acid. It is a neutral retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha-selective antagonist (Ki = 2.5 nM). It displays no significant effect on nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) binding; moderately decreases SMRT binding to RAR. It antagonizes agonist-induced coactivator (CoA) recruitment. It has a role as a retinoic acid receptor alpha antagonist. It is a member of quinolines, a member of benzoic acids and a secondary carboxamide.
