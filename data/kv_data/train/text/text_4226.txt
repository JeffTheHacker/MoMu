it is the monomethanesulfonic acid salt of delavirdine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity specific for HIV-1. Viral resistance emerges rapidly when delavirdine is used alone, so it is therefore used (as the methanesulfonic acid salt) with other antiretrovirals for combination therapy of HIV infection. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It contains a delavirdine. it is a mesylate salt form of delavirdine, a synthetic, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In combination with other anti-retroviral drugs, this agent has been shown to reduce HIV viral load and increase CD4 leukocyte counts in patients. As an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, delavirdine may result in increased serum levels of co-administered protease inhibitors metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.
