it is a 2'-deoxycytidine hydrochloriode having geminal fluoro substituents in the 2'-position. An inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, it is used in the treatment of various carcinomas, including non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent, an antiviral drug, an antimetabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 1.17.4.1 (ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase) inhibitor, a radiosensitizing agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is an organofluorine compound and a hydrochloride. It contains a gemcitabine. Gemcitabine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt of an analogue of the antimetabolite nucleoside deoxycytidine with antineoplastic activity. Gemcitabine is converted intracellularly to the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate (dFdCDP, dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in DNA strand termination and apoptosis.
