it is a 1-ribosylimidazolecarboxamide in which the carboxamide group is situated at position 4 of the imidazole ring, which is further substituted at position 5 by an amino group. A purine nucleoside analogue and activator of AMP-activated protein kinase, it is is used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is reported to have cardioprotective effects. It has a role as a platelet aggregation inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aminoimidazole, a nucleoside analogue and a 1-ribosylimidazolecarboxamide. it is a 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) riboside, a ribnucleoside analog, and a nucleotide biosynthesis precursor with B cell pro-apoptotic activity. Following cellular uptake, it is phosphorylated to AICA ribotide (ZMP), which mimics 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK kinase (AMPKK) are activated by ZMP, which appears to be necessary for the induction of apoptosis. it-induced apoptosis also appears to require cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase activation and is p53-independent. However, the exact mechanism of it-induced apoptosis is unknown. T cells are significantly less susceptible than B cells to it-induced apoptosis. AMPK regulates several cellular systems including the cellular uptake of glucose, the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, protein synthesis, and the biogenesis of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and mitochondria.
