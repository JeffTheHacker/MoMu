it is a L-lysine derivative formed during the reaction between methylglyoxal and protein. it is a homologue of N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), an advanced glycation end-product that is formed on reaction of glyoxal or glycolaldehyde with protein and on oxidative cleavage of fructoselysine, the Amadori adduct formed on glycation of protein by glucose. It is a L-lysine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid.
