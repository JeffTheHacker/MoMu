Alphit, also known as Î±-bulnesene or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Alphit is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-bulnesene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Alpha-bulnesene can be found in cottonseed, herbs and spices, pepper (spice), and sweet basil. This makes Alpha-bulnesene a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
