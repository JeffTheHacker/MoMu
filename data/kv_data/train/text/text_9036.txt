it is a semisynthetic penicillin antibiotic carrying a 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamido group at position 6. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and an antibacterial drug. It is a semisynthetic derivative, a penicillin allergen and a penicillin. It derives from an oxacillin. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a semisynthetic beta-lactamase resistant penicillin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, thereby preventing the cross-linkage of peptidoglycans, which are critical components of the bacterial cell wall. This leads to an interruption of the bacterial cell wall and causes bacterial cell lysis.
