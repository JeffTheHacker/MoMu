5, 6-Dihydro-6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one, also known as 5-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid D-lactone or C-10 it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydropyranones. Dihydropyranones are compounds containing a hydrogenated pyran ring which bears a ketone, and contains one double bond. 5, 6-Dihydro-6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 5, 6-dihydro-6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 5, 6-Dihydro-6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one is a sweet, coconut, and creamy tasting compound that can be found in fruits. This makes 5, 6-dihydro-6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
