it is a methanesulfonate salt obtained from pergolide by mixing eqimolar amount of pergolide and methanesulfonic acid. A dopamine D2 receptor agonist which also has D1 and D2 agonist properties, it is used in the management of Parkinson's disease, although it was withdrawn from the U.S. and Canadian markets in 2007 due to an increased risk of cardiac valve dysfunction. It has a role as an antiparkinson drug and a dopamine agonist. It contains a pergolide(1+). it is a semi-synthetic ergot derivative and a dopamine agonist with antiparkinson property. it binds to and activates dopamine receptor subtypes D1 and D2, resulting in prolactin secretion inhibition, transient increase in serum concentration of growth hormone, and decrease in serum concentration of luteinizing hormone. Direct stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal system, may account for this agent's antiparkinson activity.
