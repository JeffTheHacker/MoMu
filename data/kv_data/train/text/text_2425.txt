it is an organic heterotetracyclic compound that has a furonaphthodioxole skeleton bearing 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and hydroxy substituents. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 antagonist and a plant metabolite. It is a lignan, a furonaphthodioxole and an organic heterotetracyclic compound. it is a cyclolignan alkaloid found in the mayapple plant family (Podophyllum peltatum), and a small molecule inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) with potential antineoplastic activity. it specifically inhibits the activity and downregulates the cellular expression of IGF1R without interfering with activities of other growth factor receptors, such as receptors for insulin, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and mast/stem cell growth factor (KIT). This agent shows potent activity in the suppression o f tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. IGF1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, plays a critical role in the growth and survival of many types of cancer cells.
