7-glycidyloxy-9-(2-glycidyloxycarbonylphenyl)-2-xanthone is an epoxide fluorescent probe for use in in vivo visualization of hydrogen sulfide. The probe employs a fluorescein as a fluorophore, and is equipped with an operating epoxide unit. it functions via epoxide ring opening via nucleophilic attack by H2S. It has a role as a fluorescent probe. It is an epoxide, a benzoate ester, an aromatic ether and a xanthene dye. It derives from a fluorescein.
