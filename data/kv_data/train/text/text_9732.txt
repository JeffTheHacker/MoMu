Solids containing varying amounts of it, probably as parait (polymers of formula HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about 30). A hazard to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit spread to the environment. it is an aldehyde resulting from the formal oxidation of methanol. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, an allergen, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a disinfectant, an environmental contaminant, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a one-carbon compound and an aldehyde. it is a colorless poisonous gas synthesized by the oxidation of methanol and used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, histologic fixative, and general-purpose chemical reagent for laboratory applications. it is readily soluble in water and is commonly distributed as a 37% solution in water; it, a 10% solution of it in water, is used as a disinfectant and to preserve biological specimens. Environmentally, it may be found in the atmosphere, smoke from fires, automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke. Small amounts are produced during normal metabolic processes in most organisms, including humans.
