4-fluoro-N-{2-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}benzamide is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-fluorobenzoic acid with the primary amino group of 2-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethylamine. Highly potent selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist (pKi values are 9.0, 6.6, 7.5, 6.6 and < 6.0 for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors respectively). Possibly binds between the agonist binding site and the G protein interaction switch site, affecting the activation mechanism, and may display positive cooperativity. Anxiolytic following central administration in vivo. It has a role as an anxiolytic drug and a serotonergic agonist. It is a N-arylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, a methoxynaphthalene, a member of benzamides and an organofluorine compound. It is a conjugate base of a 4-fluoro-N-{2-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}benzamide(1+).
