it, also known as (+/-)-sphaerosin or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 3'-o-methylated isoflavonoids. These are isoflavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C3' atom of the isoflavonoid backbone. Isoflavonoids are natural products derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one. Thus, sphaerosin is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, sphaerosin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, sphaerosin can be found in a number of food items such as hyacinth bean, yellow wax bean, common bean, and pulses. This makes sphaerosin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
