it is an aromatic ether. It has a role as an antilipemic drug. It derives from a valeric acid. it is a fibric acid derivative with hypolipidemic effects. it interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha) resulting in PPARalpha-mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and an increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) synthesis. This enhances triglyceride-rich lipoprotein clearance and reduces the expression of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III). The reduction in hepatic production of apoC-III results in subsequent reduction of serum levels of very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). In addition, it-mediated PPARalpha stimulation of apoA-I and apoA-II expression results in an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).
