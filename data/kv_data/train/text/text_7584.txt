it, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. it is soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found throughout most human tissues. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a naturally occurring polysaccharide composed of beta-1,4-linked glucosamine residues with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it may, through a not yet fully elucidated mechanism, reduce advanced glycation end product (AGE) levels. This may reduce the interaction between AGEs and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE, AGER), which is overexpressed in some tumor types and is associated with poor patient outcomes. AGE-RAGE interaction may induce the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a key cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor, through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB, Akt) signaling pathway. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb leads to the dissociation of the Rb-E2F complex, which triggers the activation of genes required for G1/S transition and tumorigenesis. Reducing AGE levels may limit AGE-RAGE interaction and normalize the G1 to S-phase transition, potentially reducing the development and progression of certain cancers. AGEs are non-enzymatic protein modifications produced during the normal aging process that have been shown to play a role in the development and progression of some cancers.
