It has a role as a hepatotoxic agent, an antiinfective agent and an antibacterial drug. It is an organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic, an organooxygen heterocyclic antibiotic, a nitrofuran antibiotic and an imidazolidine-2,4-dione. It derives from a semicarbazide. it is a synthetic derivative of imidazolidinedione, it inhibits bacterial DNA, RNA, and cell wall protein synthesis. Activated by bacterial flavoproteins to intermediates that inactivate bacterial ribosomal proteins, it is used prophylactically as a urinary anti-infective agent against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and for long-term suppression of infections.
