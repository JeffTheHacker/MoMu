Alpha-Tocopherolquinone, also known as D 178 or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Alpha-Tocopherolquinone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-tocopherolquinone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Alpha-tocopherolquinone can be found in anise, barley, brassicas, and spinach. This makes Alpha-tocopherolquinone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
