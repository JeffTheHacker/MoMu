These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). Homolanthionine is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, homolanthionine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
