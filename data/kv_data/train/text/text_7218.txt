it is a pyridopyrimidine that is used (as its dimethyl sulfoxide addition compound) for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, and who have not received prior BRAF inhibitor treatment. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a pyridopyrimidine, an organofluorine compound, an organoiodine compound, a member of acetamides, a ring assembly, a member of cyclopropanes and an aromatic amine. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK MAPK/ERK kinase) with potential antineoplastic activity. it specifically binds to and inhibits MEK 1 and 2, resulting in an inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling and cellular proliferation in various cancers. MEK 1 and 2, dual specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases often upregulated in various cancer cell types, play a key role in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cell growth.
