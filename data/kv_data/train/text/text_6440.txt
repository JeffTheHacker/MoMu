Beta-Santalene, also known as B-santalene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Beta-Santalene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Beta-santalene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Beta-santalene can be found in cereals and cereal products. This makes Beta-santalene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
