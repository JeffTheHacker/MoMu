it is a carboxamidine that is acetamidine in which the amino hydrogens are substituted by a (6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl and a methyl group while the hydrogen attached to the imino nitrogen is replaced by a cyano group. It has a role as a neonicotinoid insectide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a monochloropyridine, a nitrile and a carboxamidine. It derives from a 2-chloropyridine.
