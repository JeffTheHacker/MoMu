it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carboxylic acid esters. These are carboxylic acid derivatives in which the carbon atom from the carbonyl group is attached to an alkyl or an aryl moiety through an oxygen atom (forming an ester group). it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, acetylpanaxydol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, acetylpanaxydol can be found in tea. This makes acetylpanaxydol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
