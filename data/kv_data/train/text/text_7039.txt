it is a member of the class of indols which is the 2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propyl ether derivative of 1H-indol-4-ol. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an antihypertensive agent, a vasodilator agent and an antiglaucoma drug. It is a member of indoles and a secondary amine. it is an aryloxypropanolamine derivative with antihypertensive property. it competitively binds to beta-adrenergic receptors, resulting in a decrease in beta-adrenergic activities, i.e., vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. In addition, this agent blocks serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptors, thereby increasing the available serotonin in the brain. Increased serotonin levels augment the antidepressant action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
