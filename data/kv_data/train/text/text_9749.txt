(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid is the pharmacologically active (6S)-stereoisomer of 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate(2-). it is the active l-isomer of the racemic mixture of the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. Metabolically active, l-leucovorin, also known it, does not require bioactivation by dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme inhibited by folic acid antagonists. This agent may enhance the effects of fluoropyrimidines by stabilizing their binding to the enzyme thymidylate synthase. (NCI04)
