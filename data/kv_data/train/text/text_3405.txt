Prednicarbate, also known as prednicarbic acid or batmen, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gluco/mineralocorticoids, progestogins and derivatives. These are steroids with a structure based on a hydroxylated prostane moiety. Prednicarbate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Prednicarbate has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, prednicarbate is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
