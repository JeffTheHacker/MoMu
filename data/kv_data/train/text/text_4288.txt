Chenodeoxycholic acid (chenodiol) is a primary bile acid, synthesized in the liver and present in high concentrations in bile that is used therapeutically to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Chronic therapy is associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels in up to 30% of patients, but chenodiol has been linked to only rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.
