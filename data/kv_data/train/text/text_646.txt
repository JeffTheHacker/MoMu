(3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-Ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol, also known as (24S)-beta-methyl cholest-8(14)-enol or 5alpha-ergost-8(14)-en-3beta-ol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ergosterols and derivatives. These are steroids containing ergosta-5, 7, 22-trien-3beta-ol or a derivative thereof, which is based on the 3beta-hydroxylated ergostane skeleton (3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-Ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral (3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-Ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol can be found in root vegetables. This makes (3beta, 5alpha, 24S)-ergost-8(14)-en-3-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
