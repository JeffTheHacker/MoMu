Fumonisin b2 belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fumonisins. These are diesters of propane-1, 2, 3-tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and similar long-chain aminopolyol backbones (for FB1: 2S-amino-12S, 16R-dimethyl-3S, 5R, 10R, 14S, 15R-pentahydroxyeicosane). Structurally, fumonisins resemble the sphingoid bases sphinganine (SA) and sphingosine (SO) to which TCA groups have been added at the C-14 and C-15 positions. Fumonisin b2 is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, fumonisin B2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Fumonisin b2 is formally rated as a possible carcinogen (by IARC 2B) and is also a potentially toxic compound.
