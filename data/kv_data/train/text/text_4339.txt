it is a 5-methoxy-2-{[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)methyl]sulfinyl}-1H-benzimidazole that has R configuration at the sulfur atom. It is an enantiomer of an it. it is the S-isomer of omeprazole, with gastric proton pump inhibitor activity. In the acidic compartment of parietal cells, it is protonated and converted into the active achiral sulfenamide; the active sulfenamide forms one or more covalent disulfide bonds with the proton pump hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase), thereby inhibiting its activity and the parietal cell secretion of H+ ions into the gastric lumen, the final step in gastric acid production. H+/K+ ATPase is an integral membrane protein of the gastric parietal cell.
