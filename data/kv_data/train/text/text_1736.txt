it is a member of the nucleoside class of cytotoxic drugs of which gemcitabine is the market leader. OSI Pharmaceuticals develops it as a next-generation gemcitabine. The anti-tumor activity of it appeares to be less schedule dependent than gemcitabine. It is also more active than ara-C (another clinically used nucleoside analog) in all nine models and more active than either paclitaxel or cisplatin in the two lung xenograft models tested. This drug shows no unexpected toxicities; those observed appeared to be similar to other nucleoside agents.
