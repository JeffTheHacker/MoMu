it is the maleic acid salt of brompheniramine. A histamine H1 receptor antagonist, it is used for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, including rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has a role as an anti-allergic agent. It contains a brompheniramine. it is the maleate salt form of brompheniramine, an alkylamine derivative and a histamine antagonist with anticholinergic and sedative properties. it competes with histamine for the H1 receptor. This diminishes the actions of histamine on effector cells and decreases the histamine-mediated symptoms of allergic reaction such as bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability and spasmodic contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
