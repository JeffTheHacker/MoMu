Sisomicin Sulfate is the sulfate salt form of sisomicin, a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Micromonospora inyoensis. Sisomicin is strucurally similar to gentamicin but has a unique unsaturated diamino sugar. Of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, sisomicin has the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria.
