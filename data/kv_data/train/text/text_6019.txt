it appears as a colorless, odorless gas at room conditions Shipped as a liquid confined under its own vapor pressure. Noncombustible. Nontoxic but can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite by evaporative cooling. Exposure of the container to prolonged heat or fire can cause it to rupture violently and rocket.
