Chitotriose belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminoglycosides. These are molecules or a portion of a molecule composed of amino-modified sugars. Chitotriose is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Outside of the human body, chitotriose can be found in a number of food items such as saffron, mexican oregano, mammee apple, and carrot. This makes chitotriose a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
