it is a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide. Targeted to the initiation codon region of the bcl-2 mRNA, it inhibits bcl-2 mRNA translation, resulting in decreased expression of the bcl-2 protein, an apoptotic inhibitor expressed in some types of cancer and linked to tumor drug resistance. This agent may enhance the efficacy of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. (NCI04) it is the sodium salt of a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the initiation codon region of mRNA for the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. it inhibits Bcl-2 mRNA translation, which may result in decreased expression of the Bcl-2 protein and tumor cell apoptosis. This agent may enhance the efficacy of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. The anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein is an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein (OMMP) that is overexpressed in some cancer cell types and is linked to tumor drug resistance.
