it is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase proton pump with potassium-competitive acid blocking (P-CAB) activity. it binds very specifically, competitively and reversibly to the potassium binding site of the proton pump hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase), thereby inhibiting the pump's activity and the parietal cell secretion of H+ ions into the gastric lumen, the final step in gastric acid production.
