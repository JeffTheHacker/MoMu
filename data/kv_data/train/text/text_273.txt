it is a member of the class of azepinoindoles that is 1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-6H-azepino[5,4,3-cd]indol-6-one carrying additional 4-[(methylamino)methyl]phenyl and fluoro substituents at positions 2 and 8 respectively. It is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and is used (as the camsylate salt) as monotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer and deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutation. It has a role as an EC 2.4.2.30 (NAD(+) ADP-ribosyltransferase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an azepinoindole, a member of caprolactams, an organofluorine compound and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an orally bioavailable tricyclic indole and inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) 1 (PARP1), 2 (PARP2) and 3 (PARP3), with potential chemo/radiosensitizing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, it selectively binds to PARP1, 2 and 3 and inhibits PARP-mediated DNA repair. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. PARPs are enzymes activated by single-strand DNA breaks that catalyze the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which induces signaling and the recruitment of other proteins to repair damaged DNA. The PARP-mediated repair pathway plays a key role in DNA repair and is dysregulated in a variety of cancer cell types.
