it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Lymphoma, Neoplasms, Advanced Solid Tumor, and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. it is a benzyl styryl sulfone analog, and a phosphate ester prodrug of ON 013100, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon hydrolysis, it is converted to ON 013100, which blocks cyclin D mRNA translation and decreases protein expression of cyclin D. This may induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing cyclin D and eventually decrease tumor cell proliferation. Cyclin D, a member of the cyclin family of cell cycle regulators, plays a key role in cell cycle division and is often overexpressed in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors and is correlated with poor prognosis. suppresses cyclin D1 accumulation in cancer cells.
