it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthoquinones. Naphthoquinones are compounds containing a naphthohydroquinone moiety, which consists of a benzene ring linearly fused to a bezene-1, 4-dione (quinone). it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in nuts. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
