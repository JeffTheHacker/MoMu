L-trans-alpha-Amino-2-carboxycyclopropaneacetic acid, also known as alpha-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine or itI, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). L-trans-alpha-Amino-2-carboxycyclopropaneacetic acid is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, L-trans-alpha-amino-2-carboxycyclopropaneacetic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, L-trans-alpha-amino-2-carboxycyclopropaneacetic acid can be found in fruits. This makes L-trans-alpha-amino-2-carboxycyclopropaneacetic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
