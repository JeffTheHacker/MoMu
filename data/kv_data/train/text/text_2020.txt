Proline is an alpha-amino acid that is pyrrolidine bearing a carboxy substituent at position 2. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Daphnia magna metabolite. It is an alpha-amino acid and a member of pyrrolidines. It is a conjugate base of a prolinium. It is a conjugate acid of a prolinate. Proline is a cyclic, nonessential amino acid (actually, an imino acid) in humans (synthesized from glutamic acid and other amino acids), Proline is a constituent of many proteins. Found in high concentrations in collagen, proline constitutes almost a third of the residues. Collagen is the main supportive protein of skin, tendons, bones, and connective tissue and promotes their health and healing. (NCI04) it is a racemic mixture of proline, an imino acid. Proline is found in cartilage and is important for maintaining youthful skin as well as repair of muscle, connective tissue and skin damage. It is also essential for the immune system and an essential component of collagen and is important for proper functioning of joints and tendons. Proline is important for the proper functioning of joints and tendons and helps maintain and strengthen heart muscles.
