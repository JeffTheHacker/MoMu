it is a pivaloyloxymethyl ester and a penicillanic acid ester. it is the pivoxil prodrug form of sulbactam, a semi-synthetic beta-lactamase inhibitor, with beta-lactam antibiotic adjuvant activity. After oral administration of it, the ester bond is cleaved, releasing active sulbactam. The beta-lactam ring of sulbactam irreversibly binds to beta-lactamase at or near its active site, thereby blocking enzyme activity and preventing metabolism of other beta-lactam antibiotics by the enzyme.
