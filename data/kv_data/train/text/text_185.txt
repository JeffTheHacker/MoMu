it, also known as 2-methyl-3-furyl propyl disulfide or disulfide, 2-methyl-3-furyl propyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-methyl-3-(propyldithio)furan is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it has a meaty taste.
