it is a member of the class of triazoles that is propan-2-ol substituted at position 1 and 3 by 1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl groups and at position 2 by a 2,4-difluorophenyl group. It is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of mucosal candidiasis and for systemic infections including systemic candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. It has a role as a P450 inhibitor, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a difluorobenzene, a conazole antifungal drug, a triazole antifungal drug and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a 1,3-difluorobenzene. It derives from a hydride of a 1H-1,2,4-triazole. it is a synthetic triazole with antifungal activity. it preferentially inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation, resulting in the accumulation of fungal 14 alpha-methyl sterols, the loss of normal fungal sterols, and fungistatic activity. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to it inhibition.
