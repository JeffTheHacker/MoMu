it is a bufadienolide glycoside that is 3,5,11,14-tetrahydroxy-12,19-dioxobufa-20,22-dienolide attached to a 3-O-acetyl-4,6-dideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a bufadienolide glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a steroid aldehyde, a 19-oxo steroid, a 5beta-hydroxy steroid, an 11alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 14beta-hydroxy steroid and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a bufanolide.
