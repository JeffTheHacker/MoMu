it is an L-alpha-amino acid; the L-isomer of it. It has a role as a micronutrient, a nutraceutical, an anticonvulsant, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a plant metabolite, a human metabolite, an algal metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an aspartate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a it and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a L-lysinium(1+). It is a conjugate acid of a L-lysinate. It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is one of nine essential amino acids in humans required for growth and tissue repair, it is supplied by many foods, especially red meats, fish, and dairy products. it seems to be active against herpes simplex viruses and present in many forms of diet supplements. The mechanism underlying this effect is based on the viral need for amino acid arginine; it competes with arginine for absorption and entry into cells. it inhibits HSV growth by knocking out arginine. (NCI04) it is a nutritional supplement containing the biologically active L-isomer of the essential amino acid it, with potential anti-mucositis activity. Upon oral intake, it promotes healthy tissue function, growth and healing and improves the immune system. it promotes calcium uptake, is essential for carnitine production and collagen formation. As collagen is essential for connective tissue maintenance, this agent may also help heal mucosal wounds. This may help decrease and prevent mucositis induced by radiation or chemotherapy.
