6-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran, also known as a, 2, 2-trimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-methanol, 9CI or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 2-dimethyl-1-benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a 1-benzopyran moiety that carries two methyl groups at the 2-position. 6-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran can be found in fats and oils. This makes 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
