it is a member of the class of imidazoles that is 1H-imidazole in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is substituted by a 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)sulfanyl]butyl group. An antifungal agent, it is used as its nitrate salt in gynaecology for treatment of vulvovaginal infections caused by Candida species, particularly Candida albicans. It is a member of imidazoles, an aryl sulfide, a dichlorobenzene, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an imidazole antifungal drug and a conazole antifungal drug. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a synthetic imidazole derivative with fungistatic properties. it interferes with steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, thereby changing the fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This alters cell permeability and leads to growth inhibition. it nitrate is active against many dermatophytes and yeasts. It also contains antibacterial effects against some gram-positive organisms.
