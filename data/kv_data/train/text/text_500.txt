it is a xanthine that is 7H-xanthine bearing (4-methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl, methyl, but-2-yn-1-yl and 3-aminopiperidin-1-yl substituents at positions 1, 3, 7 and 8 respectively (the R-enantiomer). Used for treatment of type II diabetes. It has a role as an EC 3.4.14.5 (dipeptidyl-peptidase IV) inhibitor and a hypoglycemic agent. It is a member of quinazolines and an aminopiperidine. It derives from a 7H-xanthine. it is a potent, orally bioavailable dihydropurinedione-based inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), with hypoglycemic activity.
