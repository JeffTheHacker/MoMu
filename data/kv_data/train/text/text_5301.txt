it is the hydrochloride salt form of acotiamide, a prokinetic agent with gastrointestinal (GI) motility-enhancing activity. Although the exact mechanism by which acotiamide exerts its effect has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent appears to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AchE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (Ach). Increased Ach concentrations lead to an improvement of gastric emptying and GI motility and eventually to a reduction of dyspepsia symptoms.
