it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT03531762 (Effect of a Proton Pump Inhibitor on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of it). it is an inhibitor of MET tyrosine kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to MET tyrosine kinase and disrupts MET signal transduction pathways, which may induce apoptosis in tumor cells overexpressing this kinase. The receptor tyrosine kinase MET (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor or HGFR), is the product of the proto-oncogene c-Met and is overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types; this protein plays key roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis.
