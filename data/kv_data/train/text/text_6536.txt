it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenones are compounds containing a cylohexenone moiety, which is a six-membered aliphatic ring that carries a ketone and has one endocyclic double bond. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
