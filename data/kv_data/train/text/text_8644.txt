it is a monohydroxybenzoic acid consisting of 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine) linked to 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine via an azo bond. It has a role as a prodrug, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an anti-ulcer drug and a gastrointestinal drug. It is a conjugate acid of a it(2-). it Disodium is the disodium salt form of it, an aminosalicylate and oral prodrug that is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce the anti-inflammatory agent mesalazine. Mesalazine acts locally on the mucosa of the colon where it diminishes inflammation by blocking the production of arachidonic acid metabolites, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and other inflammatory agents. it disodium is used to treat chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
