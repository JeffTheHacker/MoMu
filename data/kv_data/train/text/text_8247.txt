2-Methylbenzyl alcohol acetate, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group. 2-Methylbenzyl alcohol acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-methylbenzyl alcohol acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2-methylbenzyl alcohol acetate can be found in parsley. This makes 2-methylbenzyl alcohol acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
