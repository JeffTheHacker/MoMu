2-it, also known as it or 3-propyl-acrolein, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain aldehydes. These are an aldehyde with a chain length containing between 6 and 12 carbon atoms. 2-it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). 2-it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces, saliva, and blood. Within the cell, 2-hexenal is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 2-it is a sweet, almond, and apple tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as soy bean, cucumber, black elderberry, and blackcurrant. This makes 2-hexenal a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. 2-it is a potentially toxic compound.
