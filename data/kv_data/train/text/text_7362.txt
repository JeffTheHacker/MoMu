4,4&#39;-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) appears as tan-colored pellets or an off-white solid. Slight odor. (NTP, 1992) 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) is a chloroaniline that consists of two 2-chloroaniline units joined by a methylene bridge. It has a role as a metabolite. 4,4-Methylenebis,2-Chloroaniline is a tan-colored, solid, chlorinated aromatic amine with an amine-like odor that emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition. 4,4-Methylenebis-2-chloroaniline is primarily used in industry as a curing agent for liquid polyurethane elastomers and is used as an experimental carcinogen in research. Exposure to this substance can cause gastrointestinal distress and severe irritation of the face and eyes. 4,4-Methylenebis-2-chloroaniline is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen and may be associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer.
