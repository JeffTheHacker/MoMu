it is a purine nucleoside in which adenine is attached to arabinofuranose via a beta-N(9)-glycosidic bond. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a nucleoside antibiotic. It is a purine nucleoside and a beta-D-arabinoside. It derives from an adenine. it Anhydrous is an anhydrous form of it, a nucleoside analog with activity against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. it is converted to a monophosphate by viral thymidine kinase and is further modified to a triphosphate form by host enzymes. it triphosphate directly inhibits DNA polymerase and also acts as a chain terminator in DNA replication.
