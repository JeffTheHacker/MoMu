it is a new drug that lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), decreases triglycerides, and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). it is a dialkyl ether dicarboxylic acid with antihyperlipidemic activity. In animal models it increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and increased HDL particle size. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, trigylcerides, and apolipoprotein C-III levels were decreased as well. In human test subjects, the HDL lowering effect of it was only seen in patients with high (>200 mg/dl) levels of triglycerides.
