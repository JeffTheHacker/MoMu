it is a sulfonamide formed by condensation of the carboxylic group of 4-chloro-3-sulfamoylbenzoic acid with the amino group of 2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-1-amine. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and a diuretic. It is a member of indoles, an organochlorine compound and a sulfonamide. It derives from a benzamide. it is an indole derivative of chlorosulphonamide and a sulfamyl diuretic with antihypertensive activity. it may interact directly with the subunits of delayed rectifier potassium channels, thereby blocking both slow and rapid K+ (IKs and IKr) currents through the channels. Through the homeostasis mechanism in balancing total ion concentration (Ca++, Na+), it reduces vascular hyperreactivity and peripheral and arterial vascular resistance, possibly by inhibiting transmembrane ionic influx, probably calcium ions, and stimulating prostaglandin E2 synthesis, thereby causing vasodilatation. it exerts its diuretic effect by inhibiting reabsorption of sodium and chloride, primarily as a result of action on the cortical diluting segment of the renal distal tubule, thereby promoting urinary excretion of water and electrolytes.
