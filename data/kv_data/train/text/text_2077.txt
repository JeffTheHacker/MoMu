it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as butenolides. These are dihydrofurans with a carbonyl group at the C2 carbon atom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
