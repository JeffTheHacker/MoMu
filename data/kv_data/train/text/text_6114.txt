it is an organic sodium salt. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.10 (H(+)/K(+)-exchanging ATPase) inhibitor and an anti-ulcer drug. It contains a pantoprazole(1-). it is the sodium salt form of a substituted benzimidazole with proton pump inhibitor activity. Pantoprazole is a lipophilic, weak base that crosses the parietal cell membrane and enters the acidic parietal cell canaliculus where it becomes protonated, producing the active metabolite sulfenamide, which forms an irreversible covalent bond with two sites of the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme located on the gastric parietal cell, thereby inhibiting both basal and stimulated gastric acid production.
