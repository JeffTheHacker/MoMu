it is a tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid obtained from a Caribbean tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata. Used for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma and relapsed ovarian cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a marine metabolite, an anti-inflammatory agent and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is an organic heteropolycyclic compound, an azaspiro compound, an oxaspiro compound, a bridged compound, a lactone, a polyphenol, an acetate ester, a hemiaminal, an organic sulfide, a tertiary amino compound and an isoquinoline alkaloid. it is a tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata with potential antineoplastic activity. Binding to the minor groove of DNA, it interferes with the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair machinery to induce lethal DNA strand breaks and blocks the cell cycle in the G2 phase.
