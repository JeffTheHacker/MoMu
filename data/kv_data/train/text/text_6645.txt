it is a beta-lactam that is azetidin-2-one which is substituted at 1, 3, and 4 by p-fluorophenyl, 3-(p-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl, and 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, respectively (the 3R,3'S,4S enantiomer). It has a role as an anticholesteremic drug, an antilipemic drug and an antimetabolite. It is a member of azetidines, an organofluorine compound and a beta-lactam. it is an azetidinone derivative and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor with lipid-lowering activity. it appears to interact physically with cholesterol transporters at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols. As a result, it causes a decrease in the level of blood cholesterol or an increase in the clearance of cholesterol from the bloodstream. Overall, the following effects observed are a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and a reduction of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and other triglycerides in the blood.
