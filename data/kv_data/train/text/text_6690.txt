it is a sulfonamide consisting of pyrimidine having methoxy substituents at the 5- and 6-positions and a 4-aminobenzenesulfonamido group at the 4-position. In combination with the antiprotozoal pyrimethamine (CHEBI:8673) it is used as an antimalarial. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and an antimalarial. It is a sulfonamide and a member of pyrimidines. it is a broad-spectrum sulfanilamide and a synthetic analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) with bacteriostatic and antimalarial properties. it competes with PABA for the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, thereby preventing the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid, the immediate precursor of folic acid. This leads to an inhibition of parasitic folic acid synthesis and de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest and cell death.
