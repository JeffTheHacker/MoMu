it is an enoate ester that is the monomethacryloyl derivative of ethylene glycol. It has a role as a polymerisation monomer and an allergen. It derives from an ethylene glycol and a methacrylic acid. it is a hydroxyester compound and a resin monomer used in desensitizing dentin. By applying it locally to sensitive teeth, sensitive areas in the teeth get sealed and block the dentinal tubules at the dentin surface from stimuli that cause pain. This prevents excitation of the tooth nerve and relieves pain caused by tooth hypersensitivity.
