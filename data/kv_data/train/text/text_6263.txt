(1R, 2R)-1, 2, 7, 7-Tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan-2-ol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other (1R, 2R)-1, 2, 7, 7-Tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan-2-ol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (1R, 2R)-1, 2, 7, 7-tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan-2-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (1R, 2R)-1, 2, 7, 7-tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan-2-ol can be found in crustaceans and fishes. This makes (1R, 2R)-1, 2, 7, 7-tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan-2-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
