it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as angular furanocoumarins. These are furanocoumarins, with a structure characterized by a furan ring angularly fused to a coumarin. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fats and oils, green vegetables, and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
