it is an orally administered tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) inhibitor with demonstrated antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it binds to Trk, thereby preventing neurotrophin-Trk interaction and Trk activation, which results in both the induction of cellular apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth in tumors that overexpress Trk. Trk, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by neurotrophins, is mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival.  Originally discovered by Array BioPharma, the agent was ultimately licensed to Loxo Oncology in 2013. it is another example of innovative new cancer therapy medications that target key, specific genetic biomarker drivers of cancer rather than particular types of tumors. it is an orally available, tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity.
