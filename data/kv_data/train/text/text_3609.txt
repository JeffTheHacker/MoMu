Leucyl-tyrosine, also known as it or leu-tyr, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. Leucyl-tyrosine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Leucyl-tyrosine has been primarily detected in feces.
