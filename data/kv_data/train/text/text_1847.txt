it is a ketone that is heptan-3-one substituted by a dimethylamino group at position 6 and two phenyl groups at position 4. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a tertiary amine, a ketone and a member of benzenes. It derives from a heptan-3-one. it is a synthetic opioid with analgesic activity. it mimics the actions of endogenous peptides at CNS opioid receptors, primarily on the mu-receptor and has actions similar to those of morphine and morphine-like agents. The characteristic morphine-like effects include analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, miosis, bradycardia and physical dependence. However, the detoxification symptoms between morphine-like agents and it differ in that the onset of it's withdrawal symptoms is slower, the course is more prolonged and the symptoms are less severe.
