3-Oxohexadecanoyl-CoA, also known as it or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain 3-oxoacyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A derivative, which is 3-oxo acylated long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms. 3-Oxohexadecanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). 3-Oxohexadecanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3-oxohexadecanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the peroxisome and cytoplasm. 3-Oxohexadecanoyl-CoA exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, 3-oxohexadecanoyl-CoA is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway. 3-Oxohexadecanoyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (lcad), short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (scad deficiency), the glutaric aciduria type I pathway, and long-chain-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (lchad).
