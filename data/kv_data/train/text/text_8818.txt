it is a dicarboximide that consists of 1-oxoisoindoline bearing an amino substituent at position 4 and a 2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl group at position 2. Inhibits the secretion of TNF-alpha. It has a role as an angiogenesis inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an immunomodulator. It is a member of isoindoles, a dicarboximide, a member of piperidones and an aromatic amine. it is a thalidomide analog with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits TNF-alpha production, stimulates T cells, reduces serum levels of the cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and inhibits angiogenesis. This agent also promotes G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of malignant cells.
