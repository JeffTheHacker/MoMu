4, 4'-Thiobis-2-butanone, also known as 5-thianona-2, 8-dione or bis(3-oxobutyl) sulfide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ketones. These are organic compounds in which a carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms R2C=O (neither R may be a hydrogen atom). Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. 4, 4'-Thiobis-2-butanone is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4, 4'-thiobis-2-butanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
