it is a member of the class of imidazoles and thiophenes that is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of high blood pressure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a member of imidazoles and a member of thiophenes. it is a competitive and reversible angiotensin II receptor antagonist with anti-hypertensive property. it blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin (AT)1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle, thereby blocking the principal pressor action of angiotensin II on the renin-angiotensin system resulting in vascular dilatation. In addition, this agent blocks angiotensin II -induced stimulation of aldosterone synthesis and secretion by the adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle cell growth. Furthermore, it inhibits sympathetic norepinephrine production, thereby further reducing blood pressure.
