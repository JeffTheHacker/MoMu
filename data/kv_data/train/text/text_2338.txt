Methylmalonyl-CoA, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. Methylmalonyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Methylmalonyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, methylmalonyl-CoA is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, methylmalonyl-CoA is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway.
