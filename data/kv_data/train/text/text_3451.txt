it is a methyl ketone that is 2-butanone in which one of the methyl hydrogens at position 4 is replaced by a 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl group. A prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, following oral administration. It is shown to have a slightly lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects than most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a methoxynaphthalene and a methyl ketone. it is a naphthylalkanone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. it is a prodrug that upon hepatic catalysis converts into the active moiety 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA). 6MNA inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis is responsible for the therapeutic effects of it. The formation of thromboxane A2, by thromboxane synthase, is also decreased and results in an inhibition of platelet aggregation.
