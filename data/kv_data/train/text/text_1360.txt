it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02160951 (Dose Escalation Study of it in Japanese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies). PIM Kinase Inhibitor it is an orally available pan-PIM protein kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. PIM kinase inhibitor it binds to and inhibits the activities of PIM-1, -2 and -3 serine/threonine kinases, which may result in the interruption of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition, the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 protein and tumor cell apoptosis in cells that overexpress PIMs. PIM kinases, downstream effectors of many cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways, play key roles in cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition and may be overexpressed in various malignancies.
