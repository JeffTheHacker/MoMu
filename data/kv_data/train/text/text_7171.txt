it is a diastereoisomeric mixture of the two fluoroethyl diastereoisomers of N-(2,6-dimethylindan-1-yl)-6-(1-fluoroethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine in which the indane moiety has 1R,2S configuration. A cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor, it is used as a pre-emergence herbicide for the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds in citrus, grapes, fruit trees, Christmas tree farms, lawns and sports fields. The two diastereoisomers have very similar biological activity; commercial material is a 95:5 mixture of the (1R,2S,fluoroethyl-R) and (1R,2S,fluoroethyl-S) diastereoisomers. It has a role as a herbicide and a cellulose synthesis inhibitor. It contains a N-[(1R,2S)-2,6-dimethyindan-1-yl]-6-[(1R)-1-fluoroethyl]-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine and a N-[(1R,2S)-2,6-dimethyindan-1-yl]-6-[(1S)-1-fluoroethyl]-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.
