6-Heptyl-5, 6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, also known as it or 5-hydroxy-2-dodecenoic acid lactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dihydropyranones. Dihydropyranones are compounds containing a hydrogenated pyran ring which bears a ketone, and contains one double bond. 6-Heptyl-5, 6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 6-heptyl-5, 6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
