it is a catecholamine that is 4-(3-aminobutyl)phenol in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is substituted by a 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl group. A beta1-adrenergic receptor agonist that has cardiac stimulant action without evoking vasoconstriction or tachycardia, it is used as the hydrochloride to increase the contractility of the heart in the management of acute heart failure. It has a role as a cardiotonic drug, a sympathomimetic agent and a beta-adrenergic agonist. It is a secondary amine and a catecholamine. it is a synthetic catecholamine with sympathomimetic activity. it is a direct-acting inotropic agent and an adrenergic agonist that stimulates primarily the beta-1 adrenoceptor, with lesser effect on beta-2 or alpha receptors. Via beta-1 adrenoceptor of the heart, this agent induces positive inotropic effect with minimal changes in chronotropic activities or systemic vascular resistance. it also causes vasodilation by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, augmented by reflex vasoconstriction resulting in increased cardiac output.
