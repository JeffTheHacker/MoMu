it, also known as Î-panasinsene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Beta-panasinsene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Beta-panasinsene can be found in tea. This makes Beta-panasinsene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
