it is a benzamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid with the amino group of 7-amino-N-hydroxyheptanamide. It is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor. It is a member of benzamides, a hydroxamic acid, a secondary carboxamide and a tertiary amino compound.
