it, also known as dhomst, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sterigmatocystins. These are a group of closely related fungal metabolites chemically characterized by a xanthone moiety fused to a dihydrodifurano or a tetrahydrodifurano moiety. The chemical difference among the various sterigmagocystins are the presence or absence of unsaturation at positions 2 and 3 of the difurano ring system, the substitution pattern on positions 6, 7, and 10 of the xanthone system and/or the substituent on position 3 of the difurano system. They are produced by Aspergilus spp. and Bipolaris spp. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, dihydro-O-methylsterigmatocystin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
