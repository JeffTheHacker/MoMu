it is a substituted phenothiazine in which the ring nitrogen at position 10 is attached to C-3 of an N,N-dimethylpropanamine moiety. It has a role as a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, an antiemetic, a dopaminergic antagonist, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of phenothiazines, an organochlorine compound and a tertiary amine. it is a phenothiazine and traditional antipsychotic agent with anti-emetic activity. it exerts its antipsychotic effect by blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors in cortical and limbic areas of the brain, thereby preventing the excess of dopamine in the brain. This leads to a reduction in psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. it appears to exert its anti-emetic activity by blocking the dopamine receptors in the chemical trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, thereby relieving nausea and vomiting.
