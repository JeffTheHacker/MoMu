it is a lipophilic, weak base with potassium-competitive acid blocking (P-CAB) activity. it concentrates highly in the gastric parietal cell canaliculus and on entering this acidic environment is instantly protonated and binds competitively and reversibly to the potassium binding site of the proton pump hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase), thereby inhibiting the pump's activity and the parietal cell secretion of H+ ions into the gastric lumen, the final step in gastric acid production.
