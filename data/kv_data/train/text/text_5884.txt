it appears as odorless yellow crystals or powder. Tasteless. (NTP, 1992) it is a dihydropyridine, a methyl ester and a C-nitro compound. It has a role as a calcium channel blocker, a vasodilator agent, a tocolytic agent and a human metabolite. it is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent. it inhibits the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, causing dilatation of the main coronary and systemic arteries and decreasing myocardial contractility. This agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein which is overexpressed in some multi-drug resistant tumors and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents. (NCI04)
