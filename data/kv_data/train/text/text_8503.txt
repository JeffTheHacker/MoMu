1-Deoxy-D-glucitol, also known as fucitol or 6-deoxy-L-gulitol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hexoses. These are monosaccharides in which the sugar unit is a is a six-carbon containing moeity. Thus, 1-deoxy-D-glucitol is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule. 1-Deoxy-D-glucitol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-deoxy-D-glucitol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-deoxy-D-glucitol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 1-deoxy-D-glucitol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
