it is a 19-membered macrocyle that is geldanamycin in which the methoxy substituent attached to the benzoquinone moiety has been replaced by an allylamino group. It is a potent inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). A less toxic analogue than geldanamycin, it induces apoptosis and displays antitumour effects. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a Hsp90 inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a secondary amino compound, an ansamycin, a carbamate ester, an organic heterobicyclic compound and a member of 1,4-benzoquinones. It derives from a geldanamycin. it is a benzoquinone antineoplastic antibiotic derived from the antineoplastic antibiotic geldanamycin. it binds to and inhibits the cytosolic chaperone functions of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 maintains the stability and functional shape of many oncogenic signaling proteins; the inhibition of HSP90 promotes the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins that may be overexpressed by tumor cells.
