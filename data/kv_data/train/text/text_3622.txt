it is an organic calcium salt that is the hemicalcium salt of rosuvastatin. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a CETP inhibitor and a cardioprotective agent. It is an organic calcium salt and a N-acyl-15-methylhexadecasphinganine-1-phosphoethanolamine. It contains a rosuvastatin(1-). Rosuvastatin Calcium is the calcium salt form of rosuvastatin, a statin with antilipidemic activity. Rosuvastatin selectively and competitively binds to and inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. This leads to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels and increase in uptake of LDL cholesterol.
