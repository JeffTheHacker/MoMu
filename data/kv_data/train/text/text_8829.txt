it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as guanidines. Guanidines are compounds containing a guanidine moiety, with the general structure (R1R2N)(R3R4N)C=N-R5. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in common bean, pulses, and soy bean. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
