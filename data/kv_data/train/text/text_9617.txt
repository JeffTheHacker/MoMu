Hydroquinone monomethyl ether appears as pink crystals or white waxy solid. (NTP, 1992) P-methoxyphenol is a member of phenols and a member of methoxybenzenes. It has a role as a metabolite. it is a synthetic derivate of hydroquinone and depigmenting agent. Although the exact mechanism of the depigmenting effects of mequinol remains unclear, it may exert its effect by oxidation of tyrosinase to cytotoxic products in melanocytes. it may also act by competitively inhibiting the formation of melanin precursors.
