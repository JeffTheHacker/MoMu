it is a cyclic hexapeptide echinocandin antibiotic which exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. It is used as the sodium salt for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, and of aspergillosis in patients who are intolerant of other therapy. It has a role as an antiinfective agent. It is an echinocandin and an antibiotic antifungal drug. it is a semi-synthetic echinocandin derived from a natural product of the fungus Coleophama empedri with potent antifungal activity. it, like other cyclic lipopeptides, noncompetitively inhibits the fungal specific enzyme 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme essential for fungal cell wall synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme weakens of the cell wall, thereby leading to osmotic lysis and eventually, fungal cell death.
