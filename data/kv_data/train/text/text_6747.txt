2, 3-Diethylpyrazine, also known as fema 3136, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. 2, 3-Diethylpyrazine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3-diethylpyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 2, 3-Diethylpyrazine is a green, hazelnut, and nutty tasting compound that can be found in cereals and cereal products, nuts, and potato. This makes 2, 3-diethylpyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
