it is a 3-hydroxy steroid that is 17beta-estradiol which has been substituted at the 15alpha and 16alpha positions by two additional hydroxy groups. It is a natural estrogen produced exclusively during pregnancy by the fetal liver. It has a role as an estrogen, an estrogen receptor agonist, a human metabolite, a human xenobiotic metabolite and an oral contraceptive. It is a 3-hydroxy steroid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, a 16alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 15alpha-hydroxy steroid and a steroid hormone. It derives from a hydride of an estrane. Therapeutic it is a synthetic steroid similar or identical to endogenous it, a short-acting estrogen with both agonistic and antagonistic estrogen receptor activity. Administered orally, therapeutic it binds to the estrogen receptor and as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) exhibits estrogen agonism in certain tissues and estrogen antagonism in others. Displaying weak estrogen activity in the uterus, it acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue. Produced solely by the human fetal liver, endogenous it is the primary estrogen metabolite of estrogen biosynthesis in the human fetal liver.
