it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenazines and derivatives. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a phenazine moiety, which is a linear tricyclic system that consists of a two benzene rings joined by a pyrazine ring. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, polycartine b is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
