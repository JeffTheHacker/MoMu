Cinnamyl alcohol, also known as styrylcarbinol or zimtalcohol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cinnamyl alcohols. These are aromatic alcohols containing a 3-phenylprop-2-en-1-ol moiety. Cinnamyl alcohol exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, cinnamyl alcohol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Cinnamyl alcohol is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, cinnamyl acetate, 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, and caffeyl alcohol. Cinnamyl alcohol is a sweet, balsam, and bitter tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as oat, chia, white mustard, and wild carrot. This makes cinnamyl alcohol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
