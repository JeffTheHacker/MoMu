it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzopyrans. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a pyran ring. Pyran a six-membered heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring, made up of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom and containing two double bonds. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fruits. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
