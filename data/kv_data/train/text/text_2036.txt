Vapors heavier than air. it is a monocyclic heteroarene with a structure consisting of a 5-membered ring containing four carbons and one oxygen, with formula C4H4O. It is a toxic, flammable, low-boiling (31â) colourless liquid. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, a hepatotoxic agent and a Maillard reaction product. It is a mancude organic heteromonocyclic parent, a member of its and a monocyclic heteroarene. it is a clear, colorless, flammable liquid cyclic ether with an ethereal odor. it is used as an intermediate in the production of tetrahydroit, pyrrole and thiophene. Inhalation exposure to this substance causes eye and skin irritation and central nervous system depression. it is mutagenic in animals and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.
