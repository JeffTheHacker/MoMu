Geosmin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tertiary alcohols. Tertiary alcohols are compounds in which a hydroxy group, -OH, is attached to a saturated carbon atom R3COH (R not H ). Geosmin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, geosmin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Geosmin is a beet, earthy, and fresh tasting compound that can be found in corn. This makes geosmin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
