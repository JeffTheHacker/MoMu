it, also known as A-campholene acetic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as monocyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing 1 ring in the isoprene chain. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, Alpha-campholene acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a jammy and raspberry tasting compound that can be found in fruits. This makes Alpha-campholene acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
