it is the monohydrate form of doxycycline. A semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic, it is used to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and treat non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis, exacerbations of bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and adult periodontitis. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It contains a doxycycline. Doxycycline is a synthetic, broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic exhibiting antimicrobial activity. Doxycycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, possibly to the 50S ribosomal subunit as well, thereby blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This leads to an inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition, this agent has exhibited inhibition of collagenase activity.
