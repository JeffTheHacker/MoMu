it, also known as minamestane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpene saponins. These are glycosylated derivatives of triterpene sapogenins. The sapogenin moiety backbone is usually based on the oleanane, ursane, taraxastane, bauerane, lanostane, lupeol, lupane, dammarane, cycloartane, friedelane, hopane, 9b, 19-cyclo-lanostane, cycloartane, or cycloartanol skeleton. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
