it is an oxindole that is 3-methyleneoxindole in which one of the hydrogens of the methylene group is replaced by a 3,5-dimethylpyrrol-2-yl group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is a member of pyrroles, a member of oxindoles and an olefinic compound. It derives from a 3-methyleneoxindole. it is a quinolone derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. it reversibly inhibits ATP binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which may inhibit VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration and proliferation and reduce the tumor microvasculature. This agent also inhibits the phosphorylation of the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit, often expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia cells.
