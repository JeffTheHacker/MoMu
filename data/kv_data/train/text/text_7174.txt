(Â±)-2, 2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclic ketones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone that is conjugated to a cyclic moiety (Â±)-2, 2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (Â±)-2, 2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (Â±)-2, 2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone can be found in beverages, fruits, and tea. This makes (Â±)-2, 2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
