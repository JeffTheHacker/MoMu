Sarmoxicillin is an amoxicillin prodrug and the methoxymethyl ester of hetamoxicillin with antibacterial activity. Sarmoxicillin is hydrolyzed in vivo by esterases to its active metabolite amoxicillin. Amoxicillin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing cell lysis.
