it, also known as 2-it or 2-(mercaptomethyl)thiophene, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-thiophenemethanethiol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it has a coffee, fishy, and roast taste.
