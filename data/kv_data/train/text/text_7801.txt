Rifampin (also referred to as it) is a macrocyclic antibiotic with major activity against mycobacteria, commonly used in combination with other agents as therapy of tuberculosis. Rifampin is associated with transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and is a well known cause of clinically apparent, acute liver disease that can be severe and even fatal. Rifampin is a semisynthetic derivative of rifamycin with broad antibacterial activity. Rifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible bacteria and is often used in combination with other antibiotics for various infections including tuberculosis.
