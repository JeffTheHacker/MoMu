ite, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the beta carbon atom. ite is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, pantetheine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. ite participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, ite can be converted into pantothenic acid and cysteamine; which is mediated by the enzyme pantetheinase. In addition, ite can be converted into pantetheine 4'-phosphate; which is mediated by the enzyme pantothenate kinase 1. In humans, pantetheine is involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway and the propanoate metabolism pathway. ite is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include the methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders pathway, the malonic aciduria pathway, and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency.
