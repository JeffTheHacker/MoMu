ite, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrenes and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthrene moiety, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three non-linearly fused benzene. ite exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, neopine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, neopine can be found in opium poppy. This makes neopine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
