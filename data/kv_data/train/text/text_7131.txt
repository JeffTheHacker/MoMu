it appears as odorless colorless or white crystals or white crystalline powder. Taste is slightly sweet at first and then bitter. pH (1% aqueous solution) 5.5-6.5. pH (5% aqueous solution) 6-8. (NTP, 1992) ite is a carbohydrazide obtained by formal condensation between pyridine-4-carboxylic acid and hydrazine. It has a role as an antitubercular agent and a drug allergen. It derives from an isonicotinic acid. it is a synthetic derivative of nicotinic acid with anti-mycobacterial properties. Although its mechanism of action is still unclear, it appears to block the synthesis of mycolic acids, major components of the mycobacterial cell wall. This agent is only active against actively growing mycobacteria because, as a pro-drug, it requires activation in susceptible mycobacterial species. it also interferes with mycobacterial metabolism of vitamin B6. Resistance occurs due to decreased bacterial wall penetration. (NCI04)
