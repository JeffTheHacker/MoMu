Ammonium gluconate is a white solid with a weak odor of ammonia. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999) it is a it having D-configuration. It has a role as a chelator and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a D-gluconate. It is an enantiomer of a L-it. it is the carboxylic acid formed by the oxidation of the first carbon of glucose with antiseptic and chelating properties. it, found abundantly in plant, honey and wine, can be prepared by fungal fermentation process commercially. This agent and its derivatives can used in formulation of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food products as additive or buffer salts. Aqueous it solution contains cyclic ester glucono delta lactone structure, which chelates metal ions and forms very stable complexes. In alkaline solution, this agent exhibits strong chelating activities towards anions, i.e. calcium, iron, aluminium, copper, and other heavy metals.
