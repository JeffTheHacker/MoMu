it is the hydrochloride salt form of promazine, a phenothiazine derivative with antipsychotic and antiemetic properties. it blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors D1 and D2 in the mesolimbic and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), thereby decreasing stimulation of the vomiting center in the brain and psychotic effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. In addition, this agent blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors and exhibits strong anticholinergic activity.
