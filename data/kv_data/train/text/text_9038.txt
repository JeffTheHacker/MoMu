it is an organic sodium salt and an antibiotic antifungal drug. it Sodium is the sodium salt form of micafungin, a semi-synthetic echinocandin derived from a natural product of the fungus Coleophoma empetri with antifungal activity. it, like other cyclic lipopeptides, noncompetitively inhibits the fungal specific enzyme 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of the important fungal cell wall component 1,3-beta-D-glucan. By preventing the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, the cell wall is weakened which leads to osmotic lysis and eventually fungal cell death.
