it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pentoses. These are monosaccharides in which the carbohydrate moiety contains five carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 5-methylthioribose is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 5-methylthioribose can be found in a number of food items such as hedge mustard, atlantic herring, cucurbita (gourd), and burdock. This makes 5-methylthioribose a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
