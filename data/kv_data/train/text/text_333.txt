it is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-ylacetic acid with the anilino group of (1R)-2-{[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]amino}-1-phenylethanol. Used for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic agonist. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an aromatic amide, a member of ethanolamines and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is an orally bioavailable agonist of the human beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3), with muscle relaxing, neuroprotective and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, it binds to and activates ADRB3, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation. it also restores sympathetic stimulation in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) niches, inhibits JAK2-mutated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion and blocks the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Lack of sympathetic stimulation of the MSC and HSC niche is associated with the development of MPNs.
