Technetium Tc-99m it (commonly it) is a pharmaceutical agent used in nuclear medicine imaging. The drug is a coordination complex consisting of the radioisotope technetium-99m bound to six methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) ligands, hence the name sesta (6) MIBI.. Following intravenous injection of the drug, Technetium Tc-99m it is taken up by the myocardium, parathyroid, and/or breast tissue. The mechanism by which it localizes to these tissues has not been established. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is then performed to detect the gamma ray emmitted by the decay of Technetium-99m to Technetium-99.  Currently available within a preparation kit for injection, Technetium Tc 99m it is indicated for: 1) detecting coronary artery disease by localizing myocardial ischemia (reversible defects) and infarction (non-reversible defects); and 2) evaluating myocardial function and developing information for use in patient management decisions.
