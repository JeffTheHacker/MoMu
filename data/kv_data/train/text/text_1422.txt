Xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. Xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane can be found in fruits. This makes xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product. Xi-2, 3-dimethylhexane is a potentially toxic compound.
