it is an N-alkylpiperazine that consists of piperazine bearing 2-bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl and 3-phenylpropyl groups at positions 1 and 4 respectively. Potent, competitive inhibitor of dopamine uptake (Ki = 1 nM for inhibition of striatal dopamine uptake). Has > 100-fold lower affinity for the noradrenalin and 5-HT uptake carriers. Also a potent sigma ligand (IC50 = 48 nM). Centrally active following systemic administration. It has a role as a dopamine uptake inhibitor. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, an organofluorine compound, a tertiary amino compound and an ether. It is a conjugate base of a it(2+).
