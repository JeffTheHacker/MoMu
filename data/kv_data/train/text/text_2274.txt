Isobutyl enanthate, also known as fema 2200 or isobutyl heptoate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. Isobutyl enanthate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Isobutyl enanthate has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, isobutyl enanthate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Isobutyl enanthate has a fruity, green, and herbal taste.
