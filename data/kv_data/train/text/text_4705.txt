it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthopyrans. Naphthopyrans are compounds containing a pyran ring fused to a naphthalene moiety. Furan is a 6 membered-ring non-aromatic ring with five carbon and one oxygen atoms. Naphthalene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made up of two fused benzene rings. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in root vegetables. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
