it is 5,6-Dihydro-4H-thieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide 7,7-dioxide in which hydrogens at the 4 and 6 positions are substituted by ethylamino and methyl groups, respectively (4S, trans-configuration). A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, it is used as the hydrochloride in ophthalmic solutions to lower increased intraocular pressure in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. It has a role as an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor, an antihypertensive agent and an antiglaucoma drug. It is a sulfonamide and a member of thiophenes. it is an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, protons and bicarbonate ions. Distributed throughout many cells and tissues, various carbonic anhydrases play important roles in mineral and metabolic homeostasis. (NCI04)
