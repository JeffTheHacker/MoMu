2-Vinyl-4H-1, 3-dithiine, also known as it or 4H-1, 3-dithiin, 2-ethenyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dithiins. Dithiins are compounds comprising a dithiin ring, which is an unsaturated six-member heterocycle containing four carbon atoms, two sulfur atoms and two double bonds. 2-Vinyl-4H-1, 3-dithiine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-vinyl-4H-1, 3-dithiine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2-vinyl-4H-1, 3-dithiine can be found in garlic, onion-family vegetables, and soft-necked garlic. This makes 2-vinyl-4H-1, 3-dithiine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
