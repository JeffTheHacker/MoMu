it is an aromatic ether having phenyl and 2-methylsulfonamido-5-nitrophenyl as the two aryl groups. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is a C-nitro compound, a sulfonamide and an aromatic ether. It derives from a nitrobenzene. it is a nonsteroidal arylsulfonamide with anti-inflammatory properties. it inhibits the cyclooxygenase-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Modestly selective for COX-2, this agent binds to the enzyme, thereby inactivating it. it may inhibit some carcinogenic COX-2-related carcinogenic effects on xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, immune surveillance and angiogenesis (overexpressed COX-2 in tumor epithelial cells enhances production of vascular growth factors and the formation of capillary-like networks).
