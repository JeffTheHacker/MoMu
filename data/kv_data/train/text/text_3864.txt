it is an organic sodium salt that is the sodium salt of mycophenolic acid. An immunosuppressant, it is widely used to prevent tissue rejection following organ transplants and for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP dehydrogenase) inhibitor and an immunosuppressive agent. It contains a mycophenolate. it is the sodium salt form of mycophenolic acid (MPA), with immunosuppressing activity. In vivo, the active molecule MPA reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which is needed for guanine monophosphate synthesis and stops the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Relative to other cell types, lypmocytes are highly dependent on salvage and de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, thus making these cells prone to MPA cytotoxicity.
