it is a member of the class of penicillanic acids that is sulbactam in which one of the exocyclic methyl hydrogens is replaced by a 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl group; used (in the form of its sodium salt) in combination with ceftolozane sulfate for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antiinfective agent and an EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-lactamase) inhibitor. It is a member of penicillanic acids and a member of triazoles. It derives from a sulbactam. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a penicillanic acid sulfone derivative and beta-lactamase inhibitor with antibacterial activity. it contains a beta-lactam ring and irreversibly binds to beta-lactamase at or near its active site. This protects other beta-lactam antibiotics from beta-lactamase catalysis. This drug is used in conjunction with beta-lactamase susceptible penicillins to treat infections caused by beta-lactamase producing organisms.
