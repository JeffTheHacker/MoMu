it, also known as 2-phenylethyl caproate or fema 3221, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, phenethyl hexanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a sweet, banana, and floral tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, citrus, and fruits. This makes phenethyl hexanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
