it is an inhibitor of 11Î²-hydroxylase (also referred to as CYP11B1), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of endogenous cortisol. It is used to lower circulating cortisol levels in the treatment of Cushing's disease, a disorder in which cortisol levels are chronically and supraphysiologically elevated. Cushing's disease is often the result of ACTH hypersecretion secondary to a pituitary tumor, and surgical resection of the tumour is generally the treatment of choice. As an orally bioavailable drug therapy, it provides a novel treatment option for patients in whom removal of the causative tumor is not an option or for whom previous pituitary surgery has not been curative.  it is manufactured by Novartis under the brand name Isturisa. It has undergone phase II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumours, hypertension, and heart failure, but development for these indications was discontinued by Novartis in January 2013. it was approved for use in the EU in January 2020 for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome (i.e. Cushing's disease), and was granted FDA approval and Orphan Drug designation in the US in March 2020 for the same indication. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of both steroid 11beta-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 11B1) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2; steroid 18-hydroxylase), with potential anti-adrenal activity and ability to treat Cushing disease (CD). Upon administration, it binds to and inhibits the activity of CYP11B1, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of cortisol synthesis from the precursor 11-deoxycortisol, and CYP11B2, the enzyme that catalyzes aldosterone synthesis from corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone in the adrenal gland. The inhibition of CYP11B1 prevents the production of excess cortisol, thereby decreasing and normalizing the levels of cortisol. CD is most often caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor.
