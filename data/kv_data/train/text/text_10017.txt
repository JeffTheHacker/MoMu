Trisodium phosphonoformate hexahydrate is the hexahydrate form of trisodium phosphonoformate. It is used as an antiviral agent in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV retinitis, an inflamation of the retina that can lead to blindness) and as an alternative to ganciclovir for AIDS patients who require concurrent antiretroviral therapy but are unable to tolerate ganciclovir due to haematological toxicity. It has a role as an antiviral drug. It is a hydrate and a one-carbon compound. It contains a trisodium phosphonoformate. Foscarnet Sodium is the trisodium salt of a synthetic organic analogue of inorganic pyrophosphate with antiviral activity. Foscarnet selectively blocks the pyrophosphate binding site of herpesvirus-specific DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect cellular DNA polymerases. This agent does not require phosphorylation by thymidine kinase (TK) or other kinases and therefore is active in vitro against herpes simplex virus (HSV) TK deficient mutants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) UL97 mutants. Because foscarnet crosses the blood brain barrier, it may be used in the treatment of viral infections of the CNS.
