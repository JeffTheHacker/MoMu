it is a C19-gibberellin initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi and differing from gibberellin A1 by the absence of the OH at C-2 and the presence of a double bond between C-3 and C-3 (gibbane numbering). It has a role as a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a lactone, a C19-gibberellin and a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid.
