Heptyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid, also known as cyclohexyl octanoic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. Heptyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Heptyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as feces and urine. Within the cell, heptyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
