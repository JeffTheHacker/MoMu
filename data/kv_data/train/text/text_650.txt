it is a magnesium salt of orotic acid and is poorly soluble in water. It is a source of magnesium and is used as a mineral supplement to treat Mg deficiency. Orotic acid acts as a transporter that carries magnesium into the cells. It also exhibits antioxidant properties, since it is a key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of pyrimidines that promotes the synthesis of enzymes which act as free radical scavengers. Experiments investigating the potential cardioprotective actions of orotic acid in pathological heart conditions are still ongoing.
