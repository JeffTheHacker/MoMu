it is the (R)-enantiomer of carnitine. It has a role as an antilipemic drug, a water-soluble vitamin, a vitamin, a nutraceutical, a nootropic agent and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a (R)-carnitinium. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-carnitine. it is an amino acid derivative. it facilitates long-chain fatty acid entry into mitochondria, delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production. Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain. (NCI04)
