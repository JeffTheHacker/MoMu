it, also known as it or 5-methyl-2-(N-pyrrolidinomethyl)furan, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1-[(5-methyl-2-furanyl)methyl]pyrrolidine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-[(5-methyl-2-furanyl)methyl]pyrrolidine can be found in mollusks. This makes 1-[(5-methyl-2-furanyl)methyl]pyrrolidine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
