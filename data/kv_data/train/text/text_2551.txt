it (anhydrous) is an organic sodium salt. It contains a meclofenamic acid(1-). it is the sodium salt form of meclofenamate, an anthranilic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. it inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, by prostaglandin synthase, is responsible for the therapeutic effects of it. it also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
