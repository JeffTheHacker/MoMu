it is the anhydrous form of (S)-it. It has a role as a local anaesthetic. It contains a (S)-ropivacaine. it is the hydrochloride salt of ropivacaine, a local anesthetic of the amide type with analgesic activity. Ropivacaine binds to voltage-gated sodium ion channels in the neuronal membrane, thereby preventing the permeability of sodium ions and resulting in a stabilization of the neuronal membrane and inhibition of depolarization; nerve impulse generation and propagation are blocked, resulting in a reversible loss of sensation.
