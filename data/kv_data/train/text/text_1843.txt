Physcion 8-glucoside belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anthraquinones. These are organic compounds containing either anthracene-9, 10-quinone, 1, 4-anthraquinone, or 1, 2-anthraquinone. Thus, physcion 8-glucoside is considered to be an aromatic polyketide lipid molecule. Physcion 8-glucoside exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, physcion 8-glucoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, physcion 8-glucoside can be found in green vegetables. This makes physcion 8-glucoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
