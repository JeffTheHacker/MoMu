it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 4-disubstituted oxazoles. 2, 4-disubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2 and 4 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-methyl-2-pentyloxazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 4-methyl-2-pentyloxazole can be found in potato. This makes 4-methyl-2-pentyloxazole a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
