it is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-methylpropanoic acid with the secondary amino group of N-methyl-4-(2-methylphenyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-3-amine; an antiemetic used in combination with palonosetron hydrochloride (under the trade name Akynzeo) to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. It has a role as an antiemetic and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organofluorine compound, an aminopyridine, a member of toluenes, a N-alkylpiperazine and a N-arylpiperazine. it is a selective neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist with potential antiemetic activity. it competitively binds to and blocks the activity of the human substance P/NK1 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby inhibiting NK1-receptor binding of the endogenous tachykinin neuropeptide substance P (SP), which may result in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). SP is found in neurons of vagal afferent fibers innervating the brain-stem nucleus tractus solitarii and the area postrema, which contains the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and may be elevated in response to chemotherapy. The NK-receptor is a G-protein receptor coupled to the inositol phosphate signal-transduction pathway and is found in both the nucleus tractus solitarii and the area postrema.
