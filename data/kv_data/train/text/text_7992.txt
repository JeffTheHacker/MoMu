2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(1-hydroxy-2-{[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino}ethyl)phenol is a phenol having a hydroxymethyl group at C-2 and a 1-hydroxy-2-{[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino}ethyl group at C-4; derivative of phenylethanolamine. It is a member of phenols, an ether, a secondary alcohol, a primary alcohol and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a phenylethanolamine. it is a highly selective, long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist with bronchodilatory activity. it's benzene moiety resembles the structure of catecholamines, and occupies the active site of beta-2 adrenergic receptor, while the long, lipophilic side chain of it, binds to the so called 'exosite' near the beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The binding at the exosite allows the active portion of the molecule to remain at the receptor site and continually engage and disengage with the receptor, therefore providing a long duration of action. This agent stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase to catalyze the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels result in relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle, bronchodilation and increased bronchial airflow.
