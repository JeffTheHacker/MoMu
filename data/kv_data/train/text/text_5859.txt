it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon) it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (S)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (S)-it can be found in beverages, crustaceans, green vegetables, and tea. This makes (S)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
