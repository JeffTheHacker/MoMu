Oxalic acid dibutyl ester, also known as it or dibutyl ester OF oxalic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dicarboxylic acids and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Oxalic acid dibutyl ester exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, oxalic acid dibutyl ester is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, oxalic acid dibutyl ester can be found in nuts and tea. This makes oxalic acid dibutyl ester a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
