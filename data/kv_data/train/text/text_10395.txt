it is the orally bioavailable potassium salt of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (HIV-1 INSTI) with HIV-1 antiviral activity. Raltegravir binds to and inhibits integrase, an HIV enzyme that inserts viral genetic material into the genetic material of the infected human cell. Inhibition of integrase prevents insertion of HIV DNA into the human DNA genome, thus blocking HIV replication.
