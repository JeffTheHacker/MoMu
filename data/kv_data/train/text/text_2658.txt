it is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-O-tert-butyl-L-serine with the primary amino group of ethyl (2E,4S)-5-[(3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]-4-(L-phenylalanylamino)pent-2-enoate. It is a potent enterovirus 3C protease inhibitor with EC50 of 180 nM against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and 60 nM against human rhinovirus 14 in a live virus-cell-based assay. It has a role as an antiviral agent, an EC 3.4.22.69 (SARS coronavirus main proteinase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a benzyl ester, an ether, an ethyl ester, a L-serine derivative, a L-phenylalanine derivative, a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, an enoate ester and a secondary carboxamide.
