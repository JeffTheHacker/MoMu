N, 2, 3-Trimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)butanamide, also known as 2-isopropyl-N, 2, 3-trimethylbutanamide or fema 3804, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acyl amines. N-acyl amines are compounds containing a fatty acid moiety linked to an amine group through an ester linkage. Thus, N, 2, 3-trimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)butanamide is considered to be a fatty amide lipid molecule. N, 2, 3-Trimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)butanamide exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). N, 2, 3-Trimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)butanamide has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, N, 2, 3-trimethyl-2-(1-methylethyl)butanamide is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
