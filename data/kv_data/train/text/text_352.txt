it is a dibenzoazepine (specifically 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydrodibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]azepine) methyl-substituted on N-2. Closely related to (and now mostly superseded by) the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapinean, it is an atypical antidepressant used in the treatment of depression throughout Europe and elsewhere. It has a role as an antidepressant, a histamine agonist, a sedative, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, a serotonergic antagonist, a H1-receptor antagonist and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor.
