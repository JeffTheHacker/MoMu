it is a N-methylpiperazine. It has a role as an anticoronaviral agent. it is a thioxanthene derivative and a dopamine antagonist with antipsychotic property. it blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone, thereby decreasing dopamine activity leading to decreased stimulation of the vomiting center and psychotic effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. In addition, this agent blocks the D2 somatodendritic autoreceptor, thereby increasing dopamine turnover. it possesses weak affinity for the histamine H1 and alpha-adrenergic receptors.
