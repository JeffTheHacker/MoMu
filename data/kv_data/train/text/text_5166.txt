it is a dipeptide that is the active metabolite of ramipril. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor, a drug metabolite, a cardioprotective agent, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor and a bradykinin receptor B2 agonist. It is a cyclopentapyrrole, an azabicycloalkane, a dipeptide and a dicarboxylic acid. it is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilation. This agent also causes an increase in bradykinin levels and a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis.
