[8]-Shogaol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as shogaols. These are ginger derivatives containing a shogaol moiety, which consists of a benzene ring bearing a dec-4-en-3-one moiety, a methoxyphenyl group, a hydroxyl group and at positions 1, 3, and 4, respectively. [8]-Shogaol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, [8]-shogaol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, [8]-shogaol can be found in ginger. This makes [8]-shogaol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
