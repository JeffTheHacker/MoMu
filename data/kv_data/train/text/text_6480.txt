it (anhydrous) is an aminopyrimidine that is 2-methylpyrimidine which is substituted at position 4 by the primary amino group of 2-amino-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid and at position 6 by a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl group, and in which the carboxylic acid group has been formally condensed with 2-chloro-6-methylaniline to afford the corresponding amide. A multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, it is used, particularly as the monohydrate, for the treatment of chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Note that the name 'it' is used to refer to the monohydrate (USAN) as well as to anhydrous it (INN). It has a role as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an anticoronaviral agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound, an organochlorine compound, an aminopyrimidine, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a monocarboxylic acid amide, a N-arylpiperazine and a N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine. it Anhydrous is an orally bioavailable synthetic small molecule-inhibitor of SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinases. it binds to and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of these kinases. Apparently because of its less stringent binding affinity for the BCR-ABL kinase, it has been shown to overcome the resistance to imatinib of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells harboring BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutations. SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinases interact with variety of cell-surface receptors and participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways; tumorigenic forms can occur through altered regulation or expression of the endogenous protein and by way of virally-encoded kinase genes.
