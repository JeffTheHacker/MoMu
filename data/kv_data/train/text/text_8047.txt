it has been investigated for the treatment and basic science of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). It was approved on April 17, 2018 under the trade name Tavalisse for use in ITP. it has also been granted orphan drug status by the FDA. it is a small molecule Syk kinase inhibitor with potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activities. it inhibits Syk kinase-mediated IgG Fc gamma receptor signaling, resulting in inhibition of the activation of mast cells, macrophages, and B-cells and related inflammatory responses and tissue damage. Syk kinase, widely expressed in hematopoietic cells, is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in coupling activated immunoreceptors to signal downstream events that mediate diverse cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and phagocytosis.
