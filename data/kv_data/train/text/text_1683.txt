it is a monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 4-(1-oxo-1,3-dihydroisoindol-2-yl)phenyl group. Initially used as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic, it was withdrawn from the market due to causing severe gastrointestinal bleeding. It has been subsequently found to increase production of the survival motor neuron protein. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic and an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a member of isoindoles and a gamma-lactam. It derives from a propionic acid.
