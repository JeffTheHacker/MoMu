it, also known as benzoic acid isoamyl ester or fema 2058, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzoic acid esters. These are ester derivatives of benzoic acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-methylbutyl benzoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it is a sweet, balsamic, and green tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, cocoa and cocoa products, fruits, and papaya. This makes 3-methylbutyl benzoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
