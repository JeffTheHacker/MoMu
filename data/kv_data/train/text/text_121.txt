it is a gadolinium coordination entity that consists of Gd(3+) coordinated to 3,6,9-triazaundecadiamide in which each of the amide nitrogens is substituted by a 2-methoxyethyl group and in which the nitrogens at positions 3, 6, and 9 are each substituted by carboxylatomethyl group. The gadolinium is coordinated to the three tertiary amino groups as well as to the carboxylate groups. A white odourless powder that is freely soluble in water, gadoversetamide has paramagnetic properties and is used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging. It distributes mainly in extracellular fluid, but does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is used particularly in imaging the brain, spine and liver. It has a role as a MRI contrast agent. it is a paramagnetic extracellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that facilitates visualization of abnormal vascularity. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoversetamide decreases T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time) values in tissues where it accumulates. At the recommended dose, the effect is primarily on T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity. it does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier. However, abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoversetamide. (NCI05)
