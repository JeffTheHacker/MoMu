5, 8-Epoxydaucane, also known as carota-1, 4-oxide or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxanes. Oxanes are compounds containing an oxane (tetrahydropyran) ring, which is a six-member saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. 5, 8-Epoxydaucane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 5, 8-epoxydaucane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 5, 8-epoxydaucane can be found in carrot, root vegetables, and wild carrot. This makes 5, 8-epoxydaucane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
