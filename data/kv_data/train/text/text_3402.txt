it is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the aryl amino group of N-phenyl-1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-amine with propanoic acid. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an anaesthesia adjuvant, an intravenous anaesthetic, an adjuvant and an anaesthetic. It is a member of piperidines, an anilide and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is a synthetic, lipophilic phenylpiperidine opioid agonist with analgesic and anesthetic properties. it selectively binds to and activates the mu-receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opiates. Activation of the mu-subtype opioid receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase. This causes a decrease in intracellular cAMP which inhibits cAMP-mediated calcium influx into the cell via the calcium channels and thereby results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.
