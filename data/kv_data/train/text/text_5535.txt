it is the iodide salt of ecothiopate. An irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it is used an ocular antihypertensive in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, particularly when other drugs have proved inadequate. It has a role as an antiglaucoma drug, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and a miotic. It is an iodide salt and a quaternary ammonium salt. It contains an ecothiopate. it is the iodide salt form of echothiophate, a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor with parasympathomimetic activity. it potentiates the action of endogenous acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase that hydrolyzes acetylcholine. When applied topically to the eye, this agent prolongs stimulation of the parasympathetic receptors at the neuromuscular junctions of the longitudinal muscle of the ciliary body. Contraction of longitudinal muscle pulls on the scleral spur, and opens the trabecular meshwork, thereby increases aqueous humor outflow from the eye and reduces intraocular pressure.
