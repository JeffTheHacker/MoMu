it is a member of the class of hexahydronaphthalenes that is lovastatin in which the 2-methylbutyrate ester moiety has been replaced by a 2,2-dimethylbutyrate ester group. It is used as a cholesterol-lowering and anti-cardiovascular disease drug. It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.83 (anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase) inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a delta-lactone, a fatty acid ester, a statin (semi-synthetic) and a member of hexahydronaphthalenes. It derives from a lovastatin. it is a lipid-lowering agent derived synthetically from a fermentation product of the fungus Aspergillus terreus. Hydrolyzed in vivo to an active metabolite, it competitively inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses by suppressing MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated, antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells.
