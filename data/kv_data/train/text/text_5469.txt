(3beta, 5alpha)-3-Hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one, also known as 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregn-16-en-20-one or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 20-oxosteroids. These are steroid derivatives carrying a C=O group at the 20-position of the steroid skeleton (3beta, 5alpha)-3-Hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral (3beta, 5alpha)-3-Hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as blood and urine. Within the cell, (3beta, 5alpha)-3-hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (3beta, 5alpha)-3-hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one can be found in garden tomato. This makes (3beta, 5alpha)-3-hydroxypregn-16-en-20-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
