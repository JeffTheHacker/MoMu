it is a benzazepine that is 1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-1-benzazepin-2-one in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a carboxy methyl group and in which the 3-pro-S hydrogen is replaced by the amino group of (2S)-2-amino-4-phenylbutanoic acid. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, it is used as its monoester prodrug benazepril in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It is a benzazepine, a dicarboxylic acid and a lactam. it is the active metabolite of benazepril, a carboxyl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Once the prodrug benazepril is metabolized to it in the liver, it competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
