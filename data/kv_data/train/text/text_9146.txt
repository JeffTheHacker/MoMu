it is 7H-Furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one in which positions 2, 5, and 9 are substituted by methyl groups. Like other psoralens, it causes photosensitization of the skin. It is administered orally in conjunction with UV-A for phototherapy treatment of vitiligo. After photoactivation it creates interstrand cross-links in DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis and cell division, and can lead to cell injury; recovery from the cell injury may be followed by increased melanisation of the epidermis. It has a role as a photosensitizing agent and a dermatologic drug.
