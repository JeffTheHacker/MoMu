2, 3-Dimethyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine, also known as 5-allyl-2, 3-dimethylpyrazine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. 2, 3-Dimethyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2, 3-dimethyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2, 3-dimethyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine can be found in nuts. This makes 2, 3-dimethyl-5-(2-propenyl)pyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
