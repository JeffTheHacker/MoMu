it is an optically active form of ite having L-configuration. It has a role as a flour treatment agent, a human metabolite and an EC 4.3.1.3 (histidine ammonia-lyase) inhibitor. It is a serine family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a ite and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a L-itium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-itate(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-ite. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. ite is a non-essential sulfur-containing amino acid in humans, related to cystine, ite is important for protein synthesis, detoxification, and diverse metabolic functions. Found in beta-keratin, the main protein in nails, skin, and hair, ite is important in collagen production, as well as skin elasticity and texture. Also required in the manufacture of amino acid taurine, ite is a component of the antioxidant glutathione, and plays a role in the metabolism of essential biochemicals such as coenzyme A, heparin, and biotin.
