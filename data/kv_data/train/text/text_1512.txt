it is a synthetic imidazole derivative prodrug with an antihypertensive property. Upon hydrolysis, it is converted to olmesartan. Olmesartan selectively binds to the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor of angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle and adrenal gland, thereby competing angiotensin II binding to the receptor. This prevents angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and decreases aldosterone production, thereby preventing aldosterone-stimulated sodium retention and potassium excretion.
