it is a secondary amino compound that is noradrenaline in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by an isopropyl group. A sympathomimetic acting almost exclusively on beta-adrenergic receptors, it is used (mainly as the hydrochloride salt) as a bronghodilator and heart stimulant for the management of a variety of cardiac disorders. It has a role as a sympathomimetic agent, a beta-adrenergic agonist, a bronchodilator agent and a cardiotonic drug. It is a member of catechols, a secondary amino compound and a secondary alcohol. it is a synthetic catechol compound and potent beta adrenergic agonist with peripheral vasodilator, bronchodilator, and cardiac stimulating properties. it exerts its effect on the beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, thereby increasing heart rate and cardiac output. In addition, it acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle, thereby causing smooth muscle relaxation.
