it is a member of the class of 1,2,4-triazines in which the triazene skeleton is substituted by amino groups at positions 3 and 5, and by a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group at position 6. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, an antimanic drug, an antidepressant, a non-narcotic analgesic, a calcium channel blocker, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of 1,2,4-triazines, a primary arylamine and a dichlorobenzene. it is a synthetic phenyltriazine with antiepileptic and analgesic properties. it enhances the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which may result in a reduction of pain-related transmission of signals along nerve fibers. This agent may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, suppress glutamate release, and inhibit serotonin reuptake. (NCI04)
