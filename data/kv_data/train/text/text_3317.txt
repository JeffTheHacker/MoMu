3, 5, 5-Trimethyl-1-hexanol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty alcohols. These are aliphatic alcohols consisting of a chain of a least six carbon atoms. Thus, 3, 5, 5-trimethyl-1-hexanol is considered to be a fatty alcohol lipid molecule. 3, 5, 5-Trimethyl-1-hexanol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. 3, 5, 5-Trimethyl-1-hexanol has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3, 5, 5-trimethyl-1-hexanol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
