3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid, also known as p-methoxycinnamic acid or 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cinnamic acids. These are organic aromatic compounds containing a benzene and a carboxylic acid group forming 3-phenylprop-2-enoic acid. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid can be biosynthesized from cinnamic acid. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, (1R, 2S, 3S, 4S)-4-formyl-2-methoxy-3-[(2E)-6-methylhept-2-en-2-yl]cyclohexyl (2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylate, senegasaponin b, and senegin iii.
