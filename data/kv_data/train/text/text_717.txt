it is the tartrate salt form of brimonidine, an imidazole derivative and a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Upon ocular administration, it acts on the blood vessels causing them to constrict which leads to a decrease in the production of aqueous humor. Brimonidine tartrate also enhances the outflow of aqueous humor. This drug is used in the treatment of glaucoma to reduce intraocular pressure.
