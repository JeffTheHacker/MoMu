2-Ethyl-1, 3, 3-trimethyl-2-norbornanol, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other. 2-Ethyl-1, 3, 3-trimethyl-2-norbornanol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-ethyl-1, 3, 3-trimethyl-2-norbornanol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
