it is an organofluorine compound that is racemic prostaglandin F2alpha in which the pentyl group is replaced by a 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxymethyl group. A synthetic analogue of prostaglandin F2alpha, ophthalmic solutions of its isopropyl ester prodrug, travoprost, are used as a topical medication for controlling the progression of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure. The isopropyl ester group of travoprost is hydrolysed to the biologically active free acid by esterases in the cornea. It has a role as an antiglaucoma drug, an antihypertensive agent, a prostaglandin receptor agonist, a female contraceptive drug and an abortifacient. It is a prostaglandins Falpha, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes.
