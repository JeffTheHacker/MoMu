it is the L-enantiomer of cysteinium. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a L-cysteine and a L-cysteine zwitterion. It is an enantiomer of a D-cysteinium. itteine is a non-essential sulfur-containing amino acid in humans, related to cystine, itteine is important for protein synthesis, detoxification, and diverse metabolic functions. Found in beta-keratin, the main protein in nails, skin, and hair, itteine is important in collagen production, as well as skin elasticity and texture. Also required in the manufacture of amino acid taurine, itteine is a component of the antioxidant glutathione, and plays a role in the metabolism of essential biochemicals such as coenzyme A, heparin, and biotin.
