Acetic acid [2-[[(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl)amino]-oxomethyl]phenyl] ester is a carboxylic ester and a member of benzamides. It derives from a salicylamide. it is a synthetic benzamide with antiprotozoal activity. it exerts its antiprotozoal activity by interfering with the pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase dependent electron transfer reaction, which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. PFOR enzyme reduces it, thereby impairing the energy metabolism. However, interference with the PFOR enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction may not be the only pathway by which it exhibits antiprotozoal activity. it is active against Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum.
