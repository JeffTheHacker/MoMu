5-Chloro-2-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, also known as 2, 4-di-tert-butyl-6-(5-chloro-2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)phenol or 2-(5-chloro-2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4, 6-bis(1, 1-dimethylethyl)phenol, 9CI, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenyl-1, 2, 3-triazoles. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2, 3-triazole substituted by a phenyl group. 5-Chloro-2-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 5-chloro-2-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
