it is a 1,1-bis(phosphonic acid) consisting of methane substituted by two phosphonic acid groups. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent and a chelator. Medronic Acid is a methylene-substituted bisphosphonate. it has affinity for and adheres to the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix. This agent accumulates at sites of osteoid mineralization and can be used, complexed with radioisotopes such as technetium 99m, in bone imaging.
