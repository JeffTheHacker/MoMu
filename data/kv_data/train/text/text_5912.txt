it is a quinazoline that consists of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-4-one bearing additional methyl, 2-tolyl, sulfamyl and chloro substituents at positions 2, 3, 6 and 7 respectively. A quinazoline diuretic, with properties similar to thiazide diuretics. It has a role as a diuretic, an antihypertensive agent and an ion transport inhibitor. It is a member of quinazolines, an organochlorine compound and a sulfonamide. it is a long acting, quinazoline-based sulfonamide thiazide-like, diuretic. Similar to the thiazides, it acts on the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter, thereby preventing sodium and chloride reabsorption and excretion of water.
