it, also known as benzylcarbinyl propionate or ecopco acu, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzene and substituted derivatives. These are aromatic compounds containing one monocyclic ring system consisting of benzene. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2-phenylethyl propanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). it is a balsam, floral, and fruity tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as milk and milk products, alcoholic beverages, nuts, and ceylon cinnamon. This makes 2-phenylethyl propanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
