it is a nonhalogenated, synthetic, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral activities. Upon administration by oral inhalation into the lungs, it (CIC) is converted by local esterases to its active metabolite desisobutyryl-it (des-CIC), which binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The ligand-bound GRs regulate gene expressions, which lead to inhibitory activities against multiple cell types, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, and various mediators associated with inflammation, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes and cytokines. In addition, it may suppress the replication of human coronavirus by targeting viral nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15).
