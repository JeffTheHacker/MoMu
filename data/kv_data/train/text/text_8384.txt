it is a C21-steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a fluorinated steroid, a mineralocorticoid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid and an 11beta-hydroxy steroid. It has a role as an adrenergic agent and an anti-inflammatory drug. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane. it is a synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory and antiallergic properties. it is a mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor agonist that binds to cytoplasmic receptors, translocates to the nucleus and subsequently initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes such as lipocortins to inhibit phospholipase A2. This prevents the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both important mediators in the pro-inflammatory response mechanism. In addition, this agent exerts its mineralocorticoid effect on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney by inducing permease, an enzyme that regulates Na+ permeability in cells, thereby enhancing Na+ reabsorption and water retention as well as increasing K+, H+ excretion.
