it, also known as 3-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA or dimethylacryloyl-CoA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to an acyl chain. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the isovaleric aciduria pathway, 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase deficiency type I, the maple syrup urine disease pathway, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria pathway.
