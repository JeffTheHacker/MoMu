it is a carbamate ester that is the mono-N-isopropyl derivative of meprobamate (which is a significant metabolite). it interrupts neuronal communication within the reticular formation and spinal cord, resulting in sedation and alteration in pain perception. It is used as a muscle relaxant in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions associated with painful muscle spasm. It has a role as a muscle relaxant. it is a synthetic propanediol dicarbamate derivative and an adjunct in the treatment of painful muscle spasms, it is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that relieves stiffness, pain, and discomfort caused by muscle injuries. Its mechanism of action is not clear yet; perhaps due to its sedative actions. (NCI04)
