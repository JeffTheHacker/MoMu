Dihydro-6-isopropyl-2, 4-dimethyl-4H-1, 3, 5-dithiazine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3, 5-dithiazinanes. These are cyclic compounds that contain a dithiazinane ring, which is a saturated heterocycle that consisting of one nitrogen atom, two sulfur atoms at the 1-, 3-, and 5- position, respectively. Dihydro-6-isopropyl-2, 4-dimethyl-4H-1, 3, 5-dithiazine is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, dihydro-6-isopropyl-2, 4-dimethyl-4H-1, 3, 5-dithiazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Dihydro-6-isopropyl-2, 4-dimethyl-4H-1, 3, 5-dithiazine is a cocoa, meaty, and peanut tasting compound that can be found in mollusks. This makes dihydro-6-isopropyl-2, 4-dimethyl-4H-1, 3, 5-dithiazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
