it is a colorless to white crystalline solid with a penetrating odor. It is slightly soluble in water. It is gradually decomposed by water and very rapidly by acids to give off hydrogen bromide, a flammable and poisonous gas. Contamination with many materials can cause rapid decomposition of the material. It is toxic by inhalation of its vapors or by the hydrogen cyanide from decomposition or by ingestion. Toxic oxides of nitrogen are produced in fire involving this material. It is used in gold extraction, to make other chemicals, and as a fumigant. it is an inorganic compound used as a reagent in molecular biology. As a reagent for peptide mapping and amino acid sequence analysis, it hydrolyzes peptide bonds at methionine residues in peptides and proteins. In addition, this agent acts as a coupling reagent for phosphoramidate or pyrophosphate inter-nucleotide bonds in DNA duplexes. (NCI)
