Glycerol 1-propanoate, also known as 1-monoit, 8CI or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1-monoacylglycerols. These are monoacylglycerols containing a glycerol acylated at the 1-position. Glycerol 1-propanoate is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, glycerol 1-propanoate is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
