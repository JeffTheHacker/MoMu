2-[(Isopropylthio)methyl]furan, also known as 2-furylmethyl isopropyl sulfide or fema 3161, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. 2-[(Isopropylthio)methyl]furan is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-[(isopropylthio)methyl]furan is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2-[(Isopropylthio)methyl]furan has a coffee, floral, and meaty taste.
