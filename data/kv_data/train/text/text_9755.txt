it is a heterodetic cyclic peptide composed of 65 amino acids joined in sequence and cyclised by three disulfide bridges between cysteine residues 6-14, 16-28 and 22-39. It is a highly specific inhibitor of thrombin and used as an anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It has a role as an EC 3.4.21.5 (thrombin) inhibitor and an anticoagulant. It is a polypeptide, a heterodetic cyclic peptide and an organic disulfide. it is a yeast cell-derived recombinant polypeptide related to the naturally occurring, leech-derived anticoagulant hirudin. it directly binds to and inactivates thrombin, producing dose-dependent increases in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT). The mechanism of action of this agent is independent of antithrombin III and is not inhibited by platelet factor 4. Natural hirudin, a family of highly homologous isopolypeptides, is produced in trace amounts by the leech Hirudo medicinalis.
