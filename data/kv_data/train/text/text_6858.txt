2, 6-Dimethoxy-4-propylphenol, also known as 4-propyl-2, 6-dimethoxyphenol or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxyphenols. Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. 2, 6-Dimethoxy-4-propylphenol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 6-dimethoxy-4-propylphenol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 2, 6-Dimethoxy-4-propylphenol is a phenolic tasting compound that can be found in fishes. This makes 2, 6-dimethoxy-4-propylphenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
