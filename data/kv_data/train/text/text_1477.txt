it appears as a white crystalline solid. Soluble in water. Takes some effort to ignite but once ignited it burns with increasing vigor as the fire progresses. If contaminated with combustible materials it accelerates their burning. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in an explosion. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.
