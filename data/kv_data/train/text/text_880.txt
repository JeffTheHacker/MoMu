O-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthols and derivatives. These are naphthalene derivatives carrying one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups at any ring position. O-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. O-it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. In humans, O-it is involved in the naproxen action pathway.
