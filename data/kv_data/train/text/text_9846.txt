it is an orally available cyclic depsipeptide antibiotic produced by Aureobasidium pullulans that is a fungicide at low concentrations. Aureobasidin A inhibits inositol phosphorylceramide synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes a key step in fungal sphingolipid biosynthesis. This may inhibit fungal cell growth.
