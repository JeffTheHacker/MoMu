it, also known as L-argininosuccinate or acid, argininosuccinic, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aspartic acid and derivatives. Aspartic acid and derivatives are compounds containing an aspartic acid or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of aspartic acid at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human prostate and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from citrulline and L-aspartic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. Furthermore, it can be converted into fumaric acid and L-arginine through the action of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Furthermore, it can be converted into fumaric acid and L-arginine; which is mediated by the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Finally, it can be biosynthesized from citrulline and L-aspartic acid through its interaction with the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. In humans, it is involved in the aspartate metabolism pathway, the arginine and proline metabolism pathway, and the urea cycle pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the canavan disease pathway, arginine: glycine amidinotransferase deficiency (agat deficiency), the argininemia pathway, and the citrullinemia type I pathway. it is a potentially toxic compound.
