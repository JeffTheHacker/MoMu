it is a green crystalline solid. It is soluble in water. It is noncombustible, but it will accelerate the burning of combustible materials. If large quantities are involved in a fire or the combustible material is finely divided, an explosion may result. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in an explosion. Toxic oxides of nitrogen are produced in fires involving this material. It is used in nickel plating and to make nickel catalysts for use in chemical manufacture.
