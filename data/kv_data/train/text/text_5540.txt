Folic acid, also known as folate or vitamin m, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glutamic acid and derivatives. Glutamic acid and derivatives are compounds containing glutamic acid or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of glutamic acid at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. Folic acid is a drug which is used for treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia and in anemias of nutritional supplements, pregnancy, infancy, or childhood. Folic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Folic acid has been found in human brain, kidney and liver tissues, and has also been primarily detected in feces, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Folic acid exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Folic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Folic acid can be biosynthesized from dihydrofolic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. In addition, Folic acid can be converted into folic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme proton-coupled folate transporter. In humans, folic acid is involved in pterine biosynthesis pathway, the folate malabsorption, hereditary pathway, the folate metabolism pathway, and the methotrexate action pathway. Folic acid is also involved in the metabolic disorder called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFRD). Folic acid is a potentially toxic compound. Folic acid has been found to be associated with several diseases known as alzheimer's disease, hereditary folate malabsorption, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis; folic acid has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including folate deficiency.
