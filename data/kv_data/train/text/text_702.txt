it is a spirostanyl glycoside that consists of the trisaccharide alpha-L-Rha-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->2)]-beta-D-Glc attached to position 3 of diosgenin via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a metabolite, an antifungal agent, an antiviral agent, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a hepatoprotective agent, an apoptosis inducer and an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor. It is a spirostanyl glycoside, a spiroketal, a hexacyclic triterpenoid and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from a diosgenin. It derives from a hydride of a spirostan.
