it is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a [(2Z)-2-(2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)-4-carboxybut-2-enoyl]amino substituent at the 7 position of the cephem skeleton. An orally-administered agent, it is used as the dihydrate to treat urinary-tract and respiratory-tract infections. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a cephalosporin and a dicarboxylic acid. it is a semisynthetic, beta-lactamase-stable, third-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
