it is an organic heterooctacyclic compound that is the N-benzoyl derivative of staurosporine. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an indolocarbazole, an organic heterooctacyclic compound, a member of benzamides and a gamma-lactam. It derives from a staurosporine. it is a synthetic indolocarbazole multikinase inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. it inhibits protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinases, which may result in disruption of the cell cycle, inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis in susceptible tumors.
