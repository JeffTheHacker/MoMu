it, also known as it or dithiobis((methylsulfonyl)-methane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sulfones. Sulfones are compounds containing a sulfonyl group( which as the general structure RS(=O)2R' (R, R' =alkyl, aryl)) attached to two carbon atoms. Within the cell, bis(methylsulfonylmethyl) disulfide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, bis(methylsulfonylmethyl) disulfide can be found in mushrooms and onion-family vegetables. This makes bis(methylsulfonylmethyl) disulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
