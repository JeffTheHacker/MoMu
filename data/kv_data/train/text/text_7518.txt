it, also known as dmpse or PS(28:0), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phosphatidylserines. These are glycerophosphoserines in which two fatty acids are bonded to the glycerol moiety through ester linkages. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached to the C-1 and C-2 positions. Thus, it is considered to be a glycerophosphoserine lipid molecule. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and intracellular membrane. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be converted into PE(14:0/14:0) through its interaction with the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Furthermore, Choline and it can be biosynthesized from PC(14:0/14:0) and L-serine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylserine synthase. Furthermore, it can be biosynthesized from lyso-PS(14:0/0:0) through its interaction with the enzyme ALE1P acyltransferase. Finally, it can be biosynthesized from lyso-PS(0:0/14:0); which is mediated by the enzyme ALE1P acyltransferase. In humans, it is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis PC(14:0/14:0) pathway and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pe(14:0/14:0) pathway.
