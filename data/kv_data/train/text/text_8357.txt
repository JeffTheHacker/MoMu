it is a cephalosporin compound having (1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylsulfanyl)methyl and [(2R)-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)]acetamido side-groups. An antibacterial drug first prepared in the 1970s, it has more recently been found to be an inhibitor of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K), which is known to regulate apoptosis, autophagy and ER stress in many types of human cancers. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and an EC 2.7.11.20 (elongation factor 2 kinase) inhibitor. It is a cephalosporin, a semisynthetic derivative, a carboxylic acid, a member of triazoles, a member of phenols and an amino acid amide. it is a broad-spectrum, semisynthetic, first-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
