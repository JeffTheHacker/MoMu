it, also known as 3Î²-3-lupanol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3beta-3-lupanol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3beta-3-lupanol can be found in cereals and cereal products. This makes 3beta-3-lupanol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
