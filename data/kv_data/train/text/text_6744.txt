Deoxynivalenol, also known as RD toxin or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trichothecenes. These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzopyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetyl, or other substituents. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12, 13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain. Deoxynivalenol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, deoxynivalenol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, deoxynivalenol can be found in cereals and cereal products. This makes deoxynivalenol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product. Deoxynivalenol is a potentially toxic compound.
