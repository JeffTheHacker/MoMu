it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoquinolines and derivatives. These are aromatic polycyclic compounds containing an isoquinoline moiety, which consists of a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring and forming benzo[c]pyridine. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
