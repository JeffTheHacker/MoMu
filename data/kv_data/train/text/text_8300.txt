(3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-Stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stigmastanes and derivatives. These are sterol lipids with a structure based on the stigmastane skeleton, which consists of a cholestane moiety bearing an ethyl group at the carbon atom C24. Thus, (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol is considered to be a sterol lipid molecule (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-Stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-Stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol can be found in root vegetables. This makes (3beta, 5alpha, 24R)-stigmast-8(14)-en-3-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
