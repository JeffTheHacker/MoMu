it appears as odorless white crystalline powder or colorless lustrous crystals. Sublimes in a vacuum at about 505Â° F with some decomposition. Solutions are strong bases (pH of 0.2 molar aqueous solution is 8.4). (NTP, 1992) it is a polycyclic cage that is adamantane in which the carbon atoms at positions 1, 3, 5 and 7 are replaced by nitrogen atoms. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a polycyclic cage, a polyazaalkane and a tetramine. it is a heterocyclic organic compound with antibiotic activity. In the body it is converted to formaldehyde, a nonspecific bactericidal agent. it is typically used long-term to treat chronic urinary tract infections and to prevent the recurrence of infections.
