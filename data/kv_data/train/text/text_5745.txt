it is a dicarboximide that is a six-membered cyclic compound having ethyl and 4-aminophenyl substituents at the 3-position. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an adrenergic agent, an EC 1.14.14.14 (aromatase) inhibitor and an anticonvulsant. It is a dicarboximide, a member of piperidones and a substituted aniline. It derives from a piperidine-2,6-dione. it is a synthetic derivative of the sedative and anticonvulsant glutethimide with anti-steroid properties. Originally used as an anticonvulsant, it also blocks adrenal steroidogenesis by inhibiting the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. In addition, this agent blocks the peripheral aromatization of androgenic precursors to estrogens. it does not suppress ovarian estrogen production.
