it is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic amine with adrenergic property. it, when applied topically to the eye, stimulates the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic adrenergic nerves resulting in the stimulation of both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Local alpha stimulatory effects include dilation of the pupil, increased flow of aqueous humor, and vasoconstriction; whereas beta stimulatory effects include relaxation of the ciliary muscle and a decreased production in aqueous humor.
