it is the calcium salt form of fenoprofen, a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, non-steroidal antiinflammatory and antirheumatic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits both isozymes of cyclooxygenase; resulting in prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In addition, fenoprofen activate both peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, by which it may down-regulate leukotriene B4 production.
