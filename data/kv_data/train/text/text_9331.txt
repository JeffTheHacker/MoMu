it is amfenac in which the the hydrogen at the 4 position of the benzoyl group is substituted by bromine. It is used for the management of ocular pain and treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction. It was withdrawn from the US market in 1998, following concerns over off-label abuse and hepatic failure. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a non-narcotic analgesic. It is a member of benzophenones, a substituted aniline, an aromatic amino acid and an organobromine compound. It derives from an amfenac. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon ophthalmic administration, it binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclooxygenase II (COX II), an enzyme which converts arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides, precursors of prostaglandins (PG). By inhibiting PG formation, it is able to inhibit PG-induced inflammation, thereby preventing vasodilation, leukocytosis, disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, an increase in vascular permeability and an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP).
