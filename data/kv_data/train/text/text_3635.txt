3, 3'-Bisjuglone belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthoquinones. Naphthoquinones are compounds containing a naphthohydroquinone moiety, which consists of a benzene ring linearly fused to a bezene-1, 4-dione (quinone). 3, 3'-Bisjuglone exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3, 3'-bisjuglone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3, 3'-bisjuglone can be found in nuts. This makes 3, 3'-bisjuglone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
