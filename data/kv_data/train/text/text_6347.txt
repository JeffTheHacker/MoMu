it, also known as caloreen or british gum, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from glycogen; which is mediated by the enzyme Alpha-amylase 1. In addition, it can be converted into Alpha-D-glucose; which is mediated by the enzyme maltase-glucoamylase, intestinal. In humans, it is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, glycogen synthetase deficiency, the glycogenosis, type vi. hers disease pathway, and the mucopolysaccharidosis vi. sly syndrome pathway.
