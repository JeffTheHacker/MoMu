it is a penicillin in which the substituent at position 6 of the penam ring is a (2R)-2-[3-(methanesulfonyl)-2-oxoimidazolidine-1-carboxamido]-2-phenylacetamido group. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a penicillin and a penicillin allergen. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a broad-spectrum, beta-lactam penicillin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts the final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and eventually causing cell lysis.
