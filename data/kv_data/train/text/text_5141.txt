it, stabilized appears as a colorless odorless gas. Easily ignited. Vapors are heavier than air. May asphyxiate by the displacement of air. May violently polymerize under prolonged exposure to fire or heat, violently rupturing the container. Under prolonged exposure to fire or heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. Water insoluble. it is a synthetic, colorless, flammable gas that is insoluble in water. it is used primarily in the synthesis of polyit resins. It is also used as a monomer in the synthesis of copolymers and as a propellant for food product aerosols. When heated to decomposition, it emits highly toxic fluorocarbon fumes. The primary route of human exposure to this compound is inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure to it may result in irritation of the respiratory tract and buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Contact with this gas can cause eye irritation. This chemical is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
