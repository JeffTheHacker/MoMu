Octahydro-6-isopropyl-2(1H)-naphthalenone, also known as it or 6-isopropyl-2-decalone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclic ketones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone that is conjugated to a cyclic moiety. Octahydro-6-isopropyl-2(1H)-naphthalenone is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, octahydro-6-isopropyl-2(1H)-naphthalenone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Octahydro-6-isopropyl-2(1H)-naphthalenone has a gardenia, grapefruit, and green taste.
