Cyananin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group. Cyananin is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, cyananin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, cyananin can be found in potato. This makes cyananin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
