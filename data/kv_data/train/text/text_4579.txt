3, 5, 5-Trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one, also known as . it or b-phorone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenones are compounds containing a cylohexenone moiety, which is a six-membered aliphatic ring that carries a ketone and has one endocyclic double bond. 3, 5, 5-Trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3, 5, 5-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3, 5, 5-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one can be found in fruits, herbs and spices, and saffron. This makes 3, 5, 5-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
