it is the benzenesulfonate salt of amlodipine. It has a role as a vasodilator agent, a calcium channel blocker and an antihypertensive agent. It contains an amlodipine. it is the besylate salt of amlodipine, a synthetic dihydropyridine with antihypertensive and antianginal effects. Amlodipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions into myocardial and peripheral vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby preventing vascular and myocardial contraction. This results in a dilatation of the main coronary and systemic arteries, decreased myocardial contractility, increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, and decreased total peripheral resistance. This agent may also modulate multi-drug resistance (MDR) activity through inhibition of the p-glycoprotein efflux pump.
