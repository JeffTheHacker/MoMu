it is a dibenzoazepine derivative, having a carbamoyl group at the ring nitrogen, substituted with an oxo group at C-4 of the azepeine ring which is also hydrogenated at C-4 and C-5. It is a anticholinergic anticonvulsant and mood stabilizing drug, used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy. It has a role as an anticonvulsant and a drug allergen. It is a dibenzoazepine and a cyclic ketone. It contains a carbamoyl group. it is a dibenzazepine carboxamide derivative with an anticonvulsant property. As a prodrug, it is converted to its active metabolite, 10-monohydroxy. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, electrophysiological studies indicate this agent blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby stabilizing hyper-excited neural membranes, inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing, and decreasing the propagation of synaptic impulses.
