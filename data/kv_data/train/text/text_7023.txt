it is a member of the class of isoxazoles that is isoxazole which is substituted at positions 3, 4 and 5 by phenyl, p-sulfamoylphenyl and methyl groups, respectively. A selective cyclooxygenase 2-inhibitor, it used as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the treatment of arthritis from 2001 until 2005, when it was withdrawn following concerns of an associated increased risk of heart attack and stroke. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, an antirheumatic drug and an antipyretic. It is a member of isoxazoles and a sulfonamide. it is a sulfonamide derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. it selectively binds to and inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are involved in the regulation of pain, inflammation, and fever. This NSAID does not inhibit COX-1 at therapeutic concentrations and therefore does not interfere with blood coagulation.
