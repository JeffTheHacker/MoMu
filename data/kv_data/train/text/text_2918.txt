it is a hydroxamic acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E)-3-[4-({[2-(2-methylindol-3-yl)ethyl]amino}methyl)phenyl]prop-2-enoic acid with the amino group of hydroxylamine. A histone deacetylase inhibitor used (as its lactate salt) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is a hydroxamic acid, a member of cinnamamides, a secondary amino compound and a methylindole. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a cinnamic hydroxamic acid analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), inducing hyperacetylation of core histone proteins, which may result in modulation of cell cycle protein expression, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and apoptosis. In addition, this agent appears to modulate the expression of angiogenesis-related genes, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1a) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus impairing endothelial cell chemotaxis and invasion. HDAC is an enzyme that deacetylates chromatin histone proteins.
