it is an orally bioavailable indole derivative, with broad-spectrum antiviral and potential anti-inflammatory activities. Upon oral administration, it inhibits the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane, thereby blocking the entry of virus into host cells and preventing viral infection and replication. it may also suppress the expression of the cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and promote the expression of IL-10. This may reduce inflammation.
