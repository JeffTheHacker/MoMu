Mcl-1 Inhibitor MIK665 is an inhibitor of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1; Bcl2-L-3), with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, MIK665 binds to and inhibits the activity of Mcl-1, which promotes apoptosis of cells overexpressing Mcl-1. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell survival.
