it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as terminal alkynes. These are alkynes featuring a carbon substituent on one acetylenic carbon, and a hydrogen on the other carbon. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 9-icosyne is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 9-icosyne can be found in green vegetables. This makes 9-icosyne a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
