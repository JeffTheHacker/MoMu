it is a N-glycosyl-1,2,4-triazine that is 6-azauridine acetylated at positions 2', 3' and 5' on the sugar ring. It is a prodrug for 6-azauridine and is used for treatment of psoriasis. It has a role as an antipsoriatic and a prodrug. It is an acetate ester and a N-glycosyl-1,2,4-triazine. It derives from a 6-azauridine. it is the triacetate salt of azauridine, a synthetic triazine nucleoside derivative possessing antineoplastic and anti-psoriatic activity. After metabolism to 6-azauridine-5-prime monophosphate, 6-Azauridine inhibits de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and its 5-prime triphosphate metabolite gets incorporated into RNA, thereby preventing RNA synthesis.
