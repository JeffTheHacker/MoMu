it is a paramagnetic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), with imaging activity upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When placed in a magnetic field, it generates a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rate of nearby protons. This change in proton relaxation dynamics, iincreases the MRI signal intensity of tissues in which it has accumulated; therefore, visualization of those tissues is enhanced.
