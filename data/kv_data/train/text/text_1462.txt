it is a macrocyclic lactone that is rapamycin in which the hydroxy group attached to the cyclohexyl moiety has been converted into the corresponding 2-hydroxyethyl ether. It is an immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agent. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an immunosuppressive agent, a mTOR inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, an ether, a cyclic ketone, a cyclic acetal and a macrolide lactam. It derives from a member of sirolimus. it is a derivative of the natural macrocyclic lactone sirolimus with immunosuppressant and anti-angiogenic properties. In cells, everolimus binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate an immunosuppressive complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. Inhibition of mTOR activation results in the inhibition of T lymphocyte activation and proliferation associated with antigen and cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15) stimulation and the inhibition of antibody production.
