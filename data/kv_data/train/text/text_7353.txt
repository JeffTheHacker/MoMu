it is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (4R,12aS)-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-6,8-dioxo-3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-2H-pyrido[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1-b][1,3]oxazine-9-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 2,4-difluorobenzylamine. Used (as its sodium salt) for treatment of HIV-1. It has a role as a HIV-1 integrase inhibitor. It is an organofluorine compound, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an organic heterotricyclic compound. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is an orally bioavailable integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI), with activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Upon oral administration, it binds to the active site of integrase, an HIV enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of viral genetic material into human chromosomes. This prevents integrase from binding to retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and blocks the strand transfer step, which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. This prevents HIV-1 replication.
