all-trans-Decaprenyl diphosphate belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bactoprenol diphosphates. These are polyprenyl compounds consisting of a diphosphate group substituted by a bactoprenyl moiety. all-trans-Decaprenyl diphosphate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, all-trans-decaprenyl diphosphate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), cytoplasm and mitochondria. all-trans-Decaprenyl diphosphate exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
