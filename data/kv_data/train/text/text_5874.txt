it is the (5S)- (active) enantiomer of zopiclone. Unlike almost all other hypnotic sedatives, which are approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia, it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for long-term use. It has a role as a sedative and a central nervous system depressant. It is an enantiomer of a (5R)-zopiclone. it is a nonbenzodiazepine, cyclopyrrolone and active stereoisomer of zopiclone with hypnotic and sedative activity and without significant anxiolytic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated, it is able to bind to and activate the omega-1 subtype of the alpha subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine GABA receptor complex (GABA-A), a chloride ionophore complex in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to the opening of chloride channels, causing hyperpolarization, inhibition of neuronal firing, and enhancement of the inhibitory effect of GABA. This eventually leads to a hypnotic effect and allows for an induction of sleep.
