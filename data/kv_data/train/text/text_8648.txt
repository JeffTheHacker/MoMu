it has been used in trials studying the treatment of LYMPHOMA and Solid Tumors. It is a synthetic triterpenoid and a highly potent activator of redox-sensitive signaling pathways that induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells that are under high levels of intrinsic oxidative stress. In contrast, it in normal cells induces protective antioxidant/anti-inflammatory responses. it is a synthetic triterpenoid compound with potential antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory activities. it blocks the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2), two enzymes involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. This agent also inhibits the interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory proteins matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and the expression of Bcl-3; Bcl-3 is an IL-1-responsive gene that preferentially contributes to MMP-1 gene expression.
