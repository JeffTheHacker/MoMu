it is a itane alkaloid that is a highly potent opiate analgesic psychoactive drug. it acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain but has a high potential for addiction, with tolerance and both physical and psychological dependence developing rapidly. it is the most abundant opiate found in Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy). It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a vasodilator agent, an anaesthetic and a drug allergen. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a itane alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). It derives from a hydride of a itan. it is an opiate alkaloid isolated from the plant Papaver somniferum and produced synthetically. it binds to and activates specific opiate receptors (delta, mu and kappa), each of which are involved in controlling different brain functions. In the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems, this agent exhibits widespread effects including analgesia, anxiolysis, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal system smooth muscle contraction.
