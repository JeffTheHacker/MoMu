1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-b-carboline, also known as 2-methyl-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta carbolines. Beta carbolines are compounds containing a 9H-pyrido[3, 4-b]indole moiety. 1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-b-carboline exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-b-carboline is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-b-carboline can be found in fruits. This makes 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-b-carboline a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
