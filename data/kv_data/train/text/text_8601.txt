This material has many uses, including as a precursor to the sulfur mustard family of chemical weapons. It is chemically similar to thioglycol and is expected to react in a similar way to this material. See the chemical datasheet for thioglycol for more information. it is a diol that is pentane-1,5-diol in which the methylene group at position 3 is replaced by a sulfur atom It has a role as an antioxidant, a solvent, a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a diol and an aliphatic sulfide. It derives from a mercaptoethanol. it is a hydrolysis product of mustard gas, an alkylating agent, with antineoplastic activity.
