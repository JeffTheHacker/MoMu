S-Carboxymethyl-L-cysteine, also known as 3-(carboxymethylthio)alanine or carbocisteine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cysteine and derivatives. Cysteine and derivatives are compounds containing cysteine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of cysteine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. S-Carboxymethyl-L-cysteine exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine can be found in root vegetables. This makes S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
