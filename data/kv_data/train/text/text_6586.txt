it is a D-alanine derivative arising from reductive N-alkylation of D-alanine by pyridoxal-5-phosphate. It has a role as an epitope. It is a D-alanine derivative, a D-alpha-amino acid, a monohydroxypyridine and a phosphate monoester. It derives from a pyridoxal. It is a conjugate acid of a N-(5'-phosphonatopyridoxyl)-D-alaninate(2-). It is an enantiomer of a N-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)-L-alanine.
