it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 5-disubstituted oxazoles. 2, 5-disubstituted oxazoles are compounds containing an oxazole ring substituted at positions 2 and 5 only. Oxazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with one oxygen, one nitrogen, and three carbon atoms. Isomers include 1, 2-oxazole and 1, 3-oxazole. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in nuts. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
