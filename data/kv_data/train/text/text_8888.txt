it is an aminoquinoline that is 4-[(2,4-dichloro-5-methoxyphenyl)amino]-7-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propoxy]quinoline bearing additional cyano and methoxy substituents at positions 3 and 6 respectively. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is a nitrile, a N-methylpiperazine, an aromatic ether, a tertiary amino compound, an aminoquinoline and a dichlorobenzene. it is a synthetic quinolone derivative and dual kinase inhibitor that targets both Abl and Src kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. Unlike imatinib, it inhibits the autophosphorylation of both Abl and Src kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis. Because of the dual mechanism of action, this agent may have activity in resistant CML disease, other myeloid malignancies and solid tumors. Abl kinase is upregulated in the presence of the abnormal Bcr-abl fusion protein which is commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Overexpression of specific Src kinases is also associated with the imatinib-resistant CML phenotype.
