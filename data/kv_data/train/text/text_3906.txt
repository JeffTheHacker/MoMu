it is a potent, second-generation sulfonylurea with antihyperglycemic activity. Like other second-generation compounds, it exerts greater binding affinity to SUR1 and increased potency compared to first-generation compounds. In addition, this agent exerts peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonistic activity.
