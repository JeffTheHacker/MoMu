it appears as a clear colorless volatile liquid with an ethereal odor. Flash point near 0Â°F. Density about 6.9 lb / gal. Soluble in water. Boiling point near 140Â°F. Flammable over a wide range of vapor-air concentrations. May polymerize with the evolution of heat and possible rupture of container if contaminated. Vapors irritate eyes, skin and respiratory system. Prolonged contact with skin may cause in delayed burns. Vapors are heavier than air. Used as an intermediate to make various polymers. Chemicals that polymerize are often stabilized by refrigeration.
