it is a C-glycosyl compound consisting of a beta-glucosyl residue having a (4-chloro-3-{4-[(3S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy]benzyl}phenyl group at the anomeric centre. A sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has a role as a sodium-glucose transport protein subtype 2 inhibitor and a hypoglycemic agent. It is a C-glycosyl compound, an aromatic ether, a tetrahydrofuryl ether and a member of monochlorobenzenes. it is an orally available competitive inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2; SLC5A2) with antihyperglycemic activity. Upon oral administration, it selectively and potently inhibits SGLT2 in the kidneys, thereby suppressing the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 increases urinary glucose excretion by the kidneys, resulting in a reduction of plasma glucose levels in an insulin-independent manner. SGLT2, a transport protein exclusively expressed in the proximal renal tubules, mediates approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption from tubular fluid.
