it is a sulfoxide and a member of pyrazolidines. It has a role as a uricosuric drug. it is a phenylbutazone derivative with uricosuric and antithrombotic properties. it competitively inhibits reabsorption of urate at the proximal renal tubule in the kidney. This agent acts on the organic anion transport exchanger, thereby increasing uric acid excretion and decreasing serum uric acid levels resulting in the prevention of urate deposition. it also blocks tubular excretion of various acidic drugs, resulting in increased serum concentration of the drugs. In addition, it and its active metabolite inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2, by competitively inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing platelet aggregation through restoration of platelet survival time to normal, and decreasing platelet adhesiveness to subendothelial cells.
