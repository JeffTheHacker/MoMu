(1R*, 3R*, 6S*)-it, also known as 3-caraneol or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other (1R*, 3R*, 6S*)-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (1R*, 3R*, 6S*)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (1R*, 3R*, 6S*)-it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (1R*, 3R*, 6S*)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
