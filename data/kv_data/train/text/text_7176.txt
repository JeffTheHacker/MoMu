it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolidine-2-ones. These are pyrrolidines which bear a C=O group at position 2 of the pyrrolidine ring. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, pterolactam is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, pterolactam can be found in green vegetables and root vegetables. This makes pterolactam a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
