it has been used in trials studying the prevention of HSV-2 and Genital Herpes. it is a thiazolylamide and helicase-primase enzyme inhibitor that is active against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). it inhibits the helicase-primase complex and prevents helicase or primase catalytic cycling of viral DNA, which interferes with DNA replication and growth. This agent does not require activation by HSV thymidine kinase and has a longer plasma half-life than nucleoside analogues.
