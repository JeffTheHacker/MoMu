it appears as a clear colorless to light yellow volatile liquid with a strong disagreeable odor. Boiling point 46Â° C. Flash point -22Â°F. Flammable over a wide vapor/air concentration range(1%-50%). Vapors are readily ignited; the heat of a common light bulb may suffice. Insoluble in water and more dense (10.5 lb / gal) than water. Hence sinks in water. Vapors are heavier than air. Used in the manufacture of rayon and cellophane, in the manufacture of flotation agents and as a solvent.
