it, also known as 2-isobutyl-3-methyl-pyrazine or 2-methyl-3-isobutylpyrazine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrazines. Pyrazines are compounds containing a pyrazine ring, which is a six-member aromatic heterocycle, that consists of two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 4) and four carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)pyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it is a green, herbal, and sugar tasting compound that can be found in coffee and coffee products, potato, and root vegetables. This makes 2-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)pyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
