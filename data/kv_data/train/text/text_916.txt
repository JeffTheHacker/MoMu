it is the orally bioavailable hydrobromide salt of the racemic bicyclic phthalene derivative citalopram with antidepressant activity. As a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram selectively inhibits the CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin, thereby potentiating serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS). This agent has minimal effects on the CNS neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA).
