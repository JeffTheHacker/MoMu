it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acyl carnitines. These are organic compounds containing a fatty acid with the carboxylic acid attached to carnitine through an ester bond. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as saliva, urine, and blood. Within the cell, 3-methylglutarylcarnitine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it can be biosynthesized from 3-methylglutaric acid. Outside of the human body, 3-methylglutarylcarnitine can be found in cow milk. This makes 3-methylglutarylcarnitine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product. it has been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency.
