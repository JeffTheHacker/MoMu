1, 3, 9-Trimethyluric acid, also known as 1, 3, 9-trimethylate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthines. These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety. 1, 3, 9-Trimethyluric acid exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 1, 3, 9-trimethyluric acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1, 3, 9-trimethyluric acid can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 1, 3, 9-trimethyluric acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
