it is an organic nitrate salt resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of oxiconazole and nitric acid. An antifungal agent, it is used in creams and powders for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections. It has a role as an antiinfective agent. It is an organic nitrate salt, a conazole antifungal drug and an imidazole antifungal drug. It contains an oxiconazole(1+). Oxiconazole Nitrate is the nitrate salt form of oxiconazole, a broad spectrum imidazole derivative with antifungal activity. Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, oxiconazole, like other azole antifungals, most likely inhibits the cytochrome P450-dependent demethylation of lanosterol. This prevents the synthesis of ergosterol which is a crucial component of fungal cell membrane. By disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis and integrity, oxiconazole alters fungal cell membrane permeability, promotes loss of essential intracellular components and eventually inhibits fungal cell growth.
