it is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear transport (SINE) compound. It is currently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a cancer which forms from antibody-producing plasma cells. This condition is typically treated with high dose [bortezomib] and dexamethasone chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplant. Other chemotherapies for multiple myeloma include [lenalidomide] and [dexamethasone], [thalidomide], and may include [melphalan] if the patient is not eligible for transplant. it was approved by the FDA in June 2019. It was granted fast track and orphan designation as well as accelerated approval based on single arm, open label trial data. The Bortezomib, it, and Dexamethasone in Patients With Multiple Myeloma (BOSTON) trial is planned to finish in 2020. it is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1 protein, exportin 1 or XPO1), with potential antineoplastic activity. it modifies the essential CRM1-cargo binding residue cysteine-528, thereby irreversibly inactivates CRM1-mediated nuclear export of cargo proteins such as tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs), including p53, p21, BRCA1/2, pRB, FOXO, and other growth regulatory proteins. As a result, this agent, via the approach of selective inhibition of nuclear export (SINE), restores endogenous tumor suppressing processes to selectively eliminate tumor cells while sparing normal cells. CRM1, the major export factor for proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types.
