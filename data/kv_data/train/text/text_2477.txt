Nalmefene is an opiate receptor antagonist which is used to treat acute opioid overdose and to help in the management of alcohol dependence and addictive behaviors. Nalmefene has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to clinically apparent liver injury. it is the hydrochloride salt form of nalmefene, a naltrexone analogue with opioid antagonistic property. Nalmefene antagonizes the effects of opioids by competing for the opioid receptors in the CNS. This results in reversal of the effects of the opioids, including reversal of analgesia, euphoria, respiratory depression, hypotension, sedation and physical dependence.
