it is a semisynthetic, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with acetoxymethyl and (2-thienylacetyl)nitrilo moieties at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the core structure. Administered parenterally during surgery and to treat a wide spectrum of blood infections. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent and an antibacterial drug. It is a semisynthetic derivative, a beta-lactam antibiotic allergen, a cephalosporin, a carboxylic acid, a member of thiophenes and an azabicycloalkene. It is a conjugate acid of a cefalotin(1-). it is a semisynthetic, beta-lactam, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs participate in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall, and in reshaping the cell wall during cell division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
