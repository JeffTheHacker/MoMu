it is an 3beta-sterol that is (22E)-ergosta-5,22-diene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3beta. It is a phytosterol found in marine algae, fish, and rapeseed oil. It has a role as an EC 1.3.1.72 (Delta(24)-sterol reductase) inhibitor, a biomarker, a human metabolite, a plant metabolite, an animal metabolite, an algal metabolite, a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor and a marine metabolite. It is an ergostanoid, a 3beta-sterol and a member of phytosterols. it is a steroid derivative characterized by the hydroxyl group in position C-3 of the steroid skeleton, elimination of carbon 24.2 of the alkyl substituent, and unsaturated bonds in position 5-6 of the B ring, and position 22-23 in the alkyl substituent. It is synthesized by several unicellular algae and some terrestrial plants.
