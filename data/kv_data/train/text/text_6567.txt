CDP-choline is a member of the class of phosphocholines that is the chloine ester of CDP. It is an intermediate obtained in the biosynthetic pathway of structural phospholipids in cell membranes. It has a role as a human metabolite, a psychotropic drug, a neuroprotective agent, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a member of phosphocholines and a member of nucleotide-(amino alcohol)s. It derives from a CDP. It is a conjugate base of a CDP-choline(1+). it is a nutritional supplement and source of choline and cytidine with potential neuroprotective and nootropic activity. it, also known as cytidine-5-diphosphocholine or CDP-choline, is hydrolyzed into cytidine and choline in the intestine. Following absorption, both cytidine and choline are dispersed, utilized in various biosynthesis pathways, and cross the blood-brain barrier for resynthesis into it in the brain, which is the rate-limiting product in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. This agent also increases acetylcholine (Ach), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine levels in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, it is involved in the preservation of sphingomyelin and cardiolipin and the restoration of Na+/K+-ATPase activity. it also increases glutathione synthesis and glutathione reductase activity, and exerts antiapoptotic effects.
