it is a second-generation, 32-amino acid peptide analogue of human amylin with antihyperglycemic activity. By mimicking amylin, it, which has a half-life similar to amylin, slows gastric emptying, inhibits digestive secretions (gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile), reduces glucagon secretion, and increases satiety. These actions result in a decrease in blood glucose levels. Furthermore, it exhibits high affinity binding to amylin, calcitonin and calcitonin-related peptide receptors. Compared to amylin, it shows a prolonged duration of action due to its slowed receptor dissociation.
