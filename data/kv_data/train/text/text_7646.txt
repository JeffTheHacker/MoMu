it is the sodium salt form of sulbactam, a beta-lactam with weak antibacterial property. it contains a beta-lactam ring and irreversibly binds to beta-lactamase at or near its active site, thereby blocking enzyme activity and preventing metabolism of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Combining this agent with a beta-lactamase sensitive antibiotic such as penicillins and cephalosporins against penicillinase-producing and beta-lactamase-producing organisms, results in a decreased turnover rate of the sensitive antibiotic and enhances its antibacterial property.
