it is the chloride salt of ethidium (a fluorochrome), it intercalates within double-stranded nucleic acids, particularly DNA. In molecular biology, the bromide salt of ethidium is used to detect and visualize DNA after electrophoresis or in cytochemical preparations. In veterinary pharmacology, it is used as a trypanosomicide. Ethidium bromide and chloride are toxic substances and potent noncompetitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
