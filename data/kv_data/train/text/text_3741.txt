Erythrose, also known as L-threose or D-erythro-tetrose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pentoses. These are monosaccharides in which the carbohydrate moiety contains five carbon atoms. Erythrose is very soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Erythrose has been found in human cartilage tissue, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, erythrose is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
