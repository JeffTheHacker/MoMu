it is an organic chloride salt having 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium as the counterion. A commonly used dye that also exhibits antioxidant, antimalarial, antidepressant and cardioprotective properties. It has a role as an EC 1.4.3.4 (monoamine oxidase) inhibitor, an acid-base indicator, a fluorochrome, an antidepressant, a cardioprotective agent, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, a histological dye, an EC 4.6.1.2 (guanylate cyclase) inhibitor, an antioxidant, an antimicrobial agent, a neuroprotective agent, a physical tracer and an antimalarial. It contains a 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium. it is a synthetic basic dye. it stains to negatively charged cell components like nucleic acids; when administered in the lymphatic bed of a tumor during oncologic surgery, it may stain lymph nodes draining from the tumor, thereby aiding in the visual localization of tumor sentinel lymph nodes. When administered intravenously in low doses, this agent may convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin.
