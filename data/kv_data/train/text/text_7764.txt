it is an organofluorine compound that is cytosine that is substituted at position 5 by a fluorine. A prodrug for the antifungal 5-fluorouracil, it is used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections. It has a role as a prodrug. It is an organofluorine compound, a pyrimidone, an aminopyrimidine, a nucleoside analogue and a pyrimidine antifungal drug. It derives from a cytosine. it is a pyrimidine compound and a fluorinated cytosine analog exhibiting antifungal activity. After penetration into the fungal cells, it is deaminated to its active metabolite 5-fluorouracil. 5-fluorouracil replaces uracil during fungal RNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting fungal protein synthesis. In addition, fluorouracil is further metabolized to 5-fluorodeoxyuridylic acid monophosphate, which inhibits thymidylate synthetase, thereby interrupting nucleotide metabolism, DNA synthesis and ultimately protein synthesis.
