it is a triterpenoid saponin that consists of anagalligenin A substituted by a caproyl group at position 22 and a beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plants of Lysimachia capillipes and has been shown to exhibit potent cytotoxicity against human A-2780 cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a bridged compound, a lactol, an alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, a cyclic ether, a diol, a secondary alcohol, a triterpenoid saponin and a hexanoate ester. It derives from an anagalligenin A. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
