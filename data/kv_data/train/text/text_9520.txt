Oxacillin sodium is an organic sodium salt. It contains an oxacillin(1-). Oxacillin Sodium Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of the sodium salt of oxacillin, a semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant and acid-stable penicillin with antibacterial activity. Oxacillin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall, eventually causing cell lysis.
