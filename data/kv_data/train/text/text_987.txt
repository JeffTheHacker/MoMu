it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroid lactones. These are sterol lipids containing a lactone moiety linked to the steroid skeleton. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine.
