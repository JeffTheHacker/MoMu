it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pentoses. These are monosaccharides in which the carbohydrate moiety contains five carbon atoms. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 1-Deoxy-L-glycero-tetrulose 4-phosphate and it can be converted into 6, 7-dimethyl-8-(D-ribityl)lumazine; which is mediated by the enzyme 6, 7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. In addition, Riboflavin and it can be biosynthesized from 6, 7-dimethyl-8-(D-ribityl)lumazine through its interaction with the enzyme riboflavin synthase.
