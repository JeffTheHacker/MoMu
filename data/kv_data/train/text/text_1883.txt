it is the acetate salt form of mafenide, a synthetic sulfonamide analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) with topical anti-infective activity. it competes with PABA for the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, thereby preventing the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid, thereby interferes with normal folic acid metabolism. As a result, de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, which requires folate metabolites, is impeded and subsequently DNA synthesis is affected. it is bacteriostatic against many gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain strains of anaerobes.
