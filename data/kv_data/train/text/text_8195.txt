4-Methoxybenzyl propanoate, also known as it or fema 2102, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group. 4-Methoxybenzyl propanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-methoxybenzyl propanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4-Methoxybenzyl propanoate has an anisic, cherry, and fruity taste.
