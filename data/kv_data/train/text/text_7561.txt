it (Doptelet), is an orally administered, small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) agonist which increases platelet number, but not platelet activation,.  This decreases the need for blood transfusions.   Patients with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver disease (leading to thrombocytopenia) often require platelet transfusions before surgical procedures to decrease the risk of bleeding. Thrombocytopenia (or decreased numbers of platelets) is a common complication in patients suffering from chronic liver disease, either as an immediate result of liver disease or a consequence of interferon-based antiviral therapy.    it was approved by the FDA on May 21, 2018 for thrombocytopenia (low platelets) in adults with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. It is administered orally as it maleate, its salt form.    Doptelet (it) is the first orally administered treatment option for patients with chronic liver disease,  allowing a large population of patients to avoid a platelet transfusion before a procedure by increasing platelet counts to the optimal level of greater or equal to 50,000 per microliter. it is an orally available platelet thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR; MPL) agonist, with potential megakaryopoiesis stimulating activity. Upon administration, it binds to and stimulates TPOR, which may lead to the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells. This increases the production of platelets and may prevent chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). TPOR is a cytokine receptor and member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily.
