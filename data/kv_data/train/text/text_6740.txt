it is a synthetic, colchicine analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. it targets and binds to colchicine-binding site on tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule polymerization, the assembly of the mitotic spindle and mitosis. This eventually results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and a reduction in cellular proliferation.
