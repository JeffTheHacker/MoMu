Garcinia acid, also known as it or D-erythro-form, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tricarboxylic acids and derivatives. These are carboxylic acids containing exactly three carboxyl groups. Garcinia acid is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, garcinia acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, garcinia acid can be found in fruits and herbs and spices. This makes garcinia acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
