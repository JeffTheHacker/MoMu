it is a salinosporamide in which the core (1R)-6-oxa-2-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-3,7-dione skeleton is substituted at positions 1, 4, and 5 by (1S)-cyclohex-2-en-1-yl(hydroxy)methyl, 2-chloroethyl, and methyl groups, respectively (the 1R,4R,5S diastereoisomer). A potent proteasome inhibitor, it has attracted interest for potential use in the treatment of various cancers. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a proteasome inhibitor. It is a salinosporamide, an organochlorine compound, an organic heterobicyclic compound, a beta-lactone and a gamma-lactam. it is a naturally-occurring salinosporamide, isolated from the marine actinomycete Salinospora tropica, with potential antineoplastic activity. it irreversibly binds to and inhibits the 20S catalytic core subunit of the proteasome by covalently modifying its active site threonine residues; inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome mediated proteolysis results in an accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, which may result in the disruption of cellular processes, cell cycle arrest, the induction of apoptosis, and the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis. This agent more may more potent and selective than the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.
