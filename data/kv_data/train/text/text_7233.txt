it, also known as rulid or macrosil, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminoglycosides. These are molecules or a portion of a molecule composed of amino-modified sugars. it is a drug which is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, roxithromycin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). In humans, roxithromycin is involved in the roxithromycin action pathway. it is a semi-synthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin that includes an N-oxime side chain on the lactone ring, with antibacterial and anti-malarial activities. it binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and leads to inhibition of bacterial cell growth and replication.
