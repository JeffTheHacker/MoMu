Decanal propyleneglycol acetal, also known as decanal or 4-methyl-2-nonyl-1, 3-dioxolane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 3-dioxolanes. These are organic compounds containing 1, 3-dioxolane, an aliphatic five-member ring with two oxygen atoms in ring positions 1 and 3. Decanal propyleneglycol acetal is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, decanal propyleneglycol acetal is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Decanal propyleneglycol acetal has a floral and green taste.
