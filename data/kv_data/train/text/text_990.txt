Linolenelaidic acid, also known as linolenelaidate or elaidolinolenic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lineolic acids and derivatives. These are derivatives of lineolic acid. Lineolic acid is a polyunsaturated omega-6 18 carbon long fatty acid, with two CC double bonds at the 9- and 12-positions. Linolenelaidic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Linolenelaidic acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, linolenelaidic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, linolenelaidic acid can be found in fats and oils. This makes linolenelaidic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
