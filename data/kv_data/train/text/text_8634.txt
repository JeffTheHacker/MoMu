5-[2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl acetate is a member of the class of thienopyridines that is 2-acetoxy-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine in which the amino hydrogen is replaced by a 2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl group. It is an acetate ester, a member of cyclopropanes, a ketone, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a tertiary amino compound and a thienopyridine. it is an orally bioavailable thienopyridine, with antiplatelet activity. Upon oral administration, the active metabolite of it targets and irreversibly binds to the platelet receptor for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thereby blocking the binding of ADP to its receptor. This inhibits ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein complex GPIIb/IIIa, fibrinogen binding to platelets and platelet adhesion and aggregation. This results in increased bleeding time.
