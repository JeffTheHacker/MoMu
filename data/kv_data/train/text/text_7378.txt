it is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2E,8R)-8-hydroxynon-2-enoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a major component of the dauer pheromone, used by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a population-density signal to promote entry into an alternate larval stage, the nonfeeding and highly persistent dauer diapause, and also synergises with ascr#2, ascr#4, and ascr#8 in male attraction. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite and a pheromone. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (2E,8R)-8-hydroxynon-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-).
