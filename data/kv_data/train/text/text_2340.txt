it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzoyl derivatives. These are organic compounds containing an acyl moiety of benzoic acid with the formula (C6H5CO-). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, duryl aldehyde is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, duryl aldehyde can be found in herbs and spices. This makes duryl aldehyde a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
