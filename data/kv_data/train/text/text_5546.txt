it is a pyrimidine 2',3'-dideoxyribonucleoside compound having cytosine as the nucleobase. It has a role as an antiviral drug, an antimetabolite and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. it is a synthetic dideoxynucleoside. After intracellular phosphorylation to its active metabolite, it preferentially inhibits the gamma form of DNA polymerase present in tumor cell mitochondria, resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell mitochondrial DNA replication and tumor cell death.
