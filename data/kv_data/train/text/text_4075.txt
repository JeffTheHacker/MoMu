it is a monocarboxylic acid that is propanoic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 3-phenoxyphenyl group. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the dihydrate form of the calcium salt is used for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with disorders such as arthritis. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, an antipyretic, a non-narcotic analgesic and a drug allergen. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, non-steroidal antiinflammatory and antirheumatic properties. it inhibits both isozymes of cyclooxygenase; resulting in prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In addition, it activates both peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, by which it may down-regulate leukotriene B4 production. it Calcium is the calcium salt form of it, a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, non-steroidal antiinflammatory and antirheumatic properties. it inhibits both isozymes of cyclooxygenase; resulting in prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.
