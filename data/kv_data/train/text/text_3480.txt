it appears as white or cream-colored odorless, tasteless powder. Sublimes above 590Â°F. Fluoresces in acidic solution. Formulated as a dust, flowable powder or wettable powder for use as a systemic fungicide and anthelmintic. it is a member of the class of benzimidazoles carrying a 1,3-thiazol-4-yl substituent at position 2. A mainly post-harvest fungicide used to control a wide range of diseases including Aspergillus, Botrytis, Cladosporium and Fusarium. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical and an antinematodal drug. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a member of 1,3-thiazoles and a benzimidazole fungicide. It derives from a hydride of a 1H-benzimidazole. it is a benzimidazole derivative with anthelminthic property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it inhibits the helminth-specific mitochondrial enzyme fumarate reductase, thereby inhibiting the citric acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration and subsequent production of ATP, ultimately leading to helminth's death. In addition, it has been suggested that it may lead to inhibition of microtubule polymerization by binding to beta-tubulin and has an overt ovicidal effect with regard to some trichostrongylids.
