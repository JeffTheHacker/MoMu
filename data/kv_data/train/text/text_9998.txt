it is a hydrate. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent. It contains a lisinopril. Lisinopril is an orally bioavailable, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Lisinopril, a synthetic peptide derivative, specifically and competitively inhibits ACE, which results in a decrease in the production of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and, so, diminished vasopressor activity. In addition, angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex is decreased which results in a decrease in sodium and water retention and an increase in serum potassium.
