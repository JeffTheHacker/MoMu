3, 4-Dimethylheptane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. 3, 4-Dimethylheptane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3, 4-dimethylheptane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3, 4-dimethylheptane can be found in green vegetables, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes 3, 4-dimethylheptane a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
