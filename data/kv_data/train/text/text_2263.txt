it is an organofluorine compound that is 1-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione substituted by a 4-chloro-3-({[2-methyl-1-oxo-1-(prop-2-en-1-yloxy)propan-2-yl]oxy}carbonyl)phenyl group at position 3. It is a herbicide which inhibits the protoporphyrinogen-oxidase enzyme in plant chloroplasts, resulting in rapid knockdown of various broadleaf and grass weeds. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor.
