it is a member of guanidines. It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-alpha-sialidase) inhibitor and an antiviral agent. it is a sialic acid-analogue neuraminidase inhibitor with antiviral activity. Administered into the respiratory tract by aerosol inhalation, it selectively binds to and inhibits influenza A and B virus neuraminidase-mediated cleavage of sialic acid residues in host cell membrane-bound glycoprotein receptors for influenza viruses, preventing the release of progeny viruses from host cell surfaces and, so, further viral replication.
