Antimony oxychloride is soluble in hydrochloric acid but insoluble in water. It is corrosive to metals and tissue. it is an inorganic chloride salt with formula SbCl3. It is used as a reagent for detecting vitamin A and related carotenoids, reacting with the carotenoid to form a blue complex that can be measured by colorimetry (the Carr-Price test).
