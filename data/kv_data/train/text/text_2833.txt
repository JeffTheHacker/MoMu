it is an alpha-amino acid ester that is the ethyl ester of N-{(2S)-1-[(2S,3aS,7aS)-2-carboxyoctahydro-1H-indol-1-yl]-1-oxopropan-2-yl}-L-norvaline It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It is an alpha-amino acid ester, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, an organic heterobicyclic compound and an ethyl ester. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Upon hydrolysis, it is converted to its active form itat, inhibiting ACE and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; consequently, angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex are inhibited and diuresis and natriuresis ensue.
