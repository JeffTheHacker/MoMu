it is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is butanamide substituted by a diisopropylamino group at position 4, a phenyl group at position 2 and a pyridin-2-yl group at position 2. It is used as a anti-arrhythmia drug. It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of pyridines and a tertiary amino compound. it is a class IA anti-arrhythmic agent with cardiac depressant property. it blocks the fast sodium channel in normal cardiac cell membranes within atrial and ventricular tissues. This slows the rate and amplitude of phase 0 depolarization and thus prolongs the duration of the action potential, thereby reducing cell excitability and conduction velocity. Further, it directly decreases the rate of diastolic (phase 4) depolarization in cells with normal or augmented automaticity. it also blocks potassium channel and results in prolonged QT interval, thus increases the effective refractory period. This agent also possesses anticholinergic property.
