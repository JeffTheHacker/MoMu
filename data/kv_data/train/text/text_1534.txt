it is a triglyceride obtained by formal acylation of the three hydroxy groups of glycerol by butyric acid. It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, a protective agent, an apoptosis inducer, a prodrug and an antineoplastic agent. It is a triglyceride and a butyrate ester. It derives from a butyric acid. it is a triglyceride prodrug of butyric acid with potential antineoplastic activity. Butyrate, the active metabolite of it, inhibits histone deacetylase, resulting in increased differentiation, decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in some tumor cell lines.
