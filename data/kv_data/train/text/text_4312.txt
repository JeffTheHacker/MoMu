it appears as white crystalline solid shipped either as a solid or in solution. A confirmed carcinogen. Toxic by skin absorption. Less dense than water and soluble in water. May be toxic by ingestion. Used for sewage and waste treatment, to make dyes, adhesives. The solid is stable at room temperature, but upon melting may violently polymerize. Toxic, irritating to skin, eyes, etc. it is a member of the class of its that results from the formal condensation of acrylic acid with ammonia. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, a neurotoxin, a mutagen, an alkylating agent and a Maillard reaction product. It is a N-acylammonia, a primary carboxamide and a member of its. It derives from an acrylic acid. it is a colorless, odorless, crystalline amide that polymerizes rapidly and can form as a byproduct during the heating of starch-rich foods to high temperatures. it is used in the production of polymers mainly in the water treatment industry, pulp and paper industry and textile treatment industry and is used as a laboratory reagent. The polymer is nontoxic, but exposure to the monomer can cause central and peripheral nervous system damage resulting in hallucinations, drowsiness and numbness in the hands and legs. it is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
