it is a fatty acid ester that is mevastatin carrying an additional methyl group on the carbobicyclic skeleton. It is used in as an anticholesteremic drug and has been found in fungal species such as Aspergillus terreus and Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom). It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite, a prodrug, an anticholesteremic drug and an antineoplastic agent. It is a polyketide, a statin (naturally occurring), a member of hexahydronaphthalenes, a delta-lactone and a fatty acid ester. It derives from a (S)-2-methylbutyric acid and a mevastatin. it is a lactone metabolite isolated from the fungus Aspergillus terreus with cholesterol-lowering and potential antineoplastic activities. it is hydrolyzed to the active beta-hydroxyacid form, which competitively inhibits 3-hydroxyl-3-methylgutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, this agent may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell invasiveness, possibly by inhibiting protein farnesylation and protein geranylgeranylation, and may arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The latter effect sensitizes tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation.
