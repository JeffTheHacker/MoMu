3, 3'-Digalloylprocyanidin b2, also known as procyanidin b2-3, 3'-di-O-gallate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as biflavonoids and polyflavonoids. These are organic compounds containing at least two flavan/flavone units. These units are usually linked through CC or C-O-C bonds. Some examples include C2-O-C3, C2-O-C4, C3'-C3''', and C6-C8''. 3, 3'-Digalloylprocyanidin b2 is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3, 3'-digalloylprocyanidin B2 is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 3, 3'-digalloylprocyanidin B2 can be found in common grape, green vegetables, and tea. This makes 3, 3'-digalloylprocyanidin B2 a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
