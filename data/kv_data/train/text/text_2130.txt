it is a macrolide antibiotic produced by various Streptomyces species that is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antibacterial drug and an antimicrobial agent. It is a macrolide, an ether, an aldehyde, a disaccharide derivative and a tertiary amino compound. Spiramycin is a macrolide originally discovered as product of Streptomyces ambofaciens, with antibacterial and antiparasitic activities. Although the specific mechanism of action has not been characterized, spiramycin likely inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This agent also prevents placental transmission of toxoplasmosis presumably through a different mechanism, which has not yet been characterized.
