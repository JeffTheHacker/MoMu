it is a differentiation-inducing factor that is hexaphenone bearing two chloro substituents at positions 3 and 5, two hydroxy substituents at positions 2 and 6 as well as a single methoxy substituent at position 4. A secreted, chlorinated molecule that controls cell fate during development of Dictyostelium cells. It has a role as a eukaryotic metabolite and a signalling molecule. It is a monomethoxybenzene, a member of resorcinols, a differentiation-inducing factor and a dichlorobenzene. It derives from a (3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)hexan-1-one. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-).
