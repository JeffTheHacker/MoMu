it is an ethyl 2-(dimethylamino)-1-phenylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylate that has S configuration at the carbon bearing the phenyl group and R configuration at the carbon bearing the dimethylamino group. The opioid analgesic tilidine is the racemate comprising equimolar amounts of it and its enantiomer, ent-it. A prodrug, tilidine is converted by the liver to the active analgesic, nortilidine; virtually all of the opioid activity resides in the (1S,2R) isomer (i.e. the isomer derived from it). It has a role as an opioid analgesic and a prodrug. It is an enantiomer of an ent-it.
