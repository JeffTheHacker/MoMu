Dopamine D1-like receptor partial agonist (Ki values are 1.18, 7.56, 920 and 399 nM for rat D1, D5, D2 and D3 receptors respectively). May act as an antagonist in vivo, producing anti-Parkinsonian effects and antagonising the behavioral effects of cocaine. It has a role as a dopamine agonist. It is a benzazepine, a member of catechols, a tertiary amino compound and an organochlorine compound. It is a conjugate base of a N-methyl-6-chloro-1-(3-methylphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-benzazepinium-7,8-diol(1+).
