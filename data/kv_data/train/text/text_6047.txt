Siccanin is a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor originally isolated from the pathogenic fungus Helminthosposium siccans with antifungal activity. Siccanin, in a quinone-dependent manner, inhibits succinate dehydrogenase in the terminal electron transport chain thereby disrupting cellular respiration.
