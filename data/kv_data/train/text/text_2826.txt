Pramipexole hydrochloride is a hydrate that is the monohydrate of the dihydrochloride salt of pramiprexole. It has a role as a dopamine agonist and an antiparkinson drug. It contains a member of pramipexole hydrochloride anhydrous and a pramipexole(2+). Pramipexole Dihydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt of pramipexole, a benzothiazole derivative. As a nonergot dopamine agonist, pramipexole binds to D2 and D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra of the brain. Compared to other dopamine agonists, the use of this agent may be associated with fewer dyskinetic side effects in treated subjects. (NCI04)
