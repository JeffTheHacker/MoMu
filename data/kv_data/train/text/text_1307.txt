it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Melanoma, Neoplasms, CNS Disease, Breast Cancer, and Breast Neoplasms, among others. It is a so-called fully synthetic epothilone and is the first such compound to be in clinical development to combat several forms of cancer. Epothilones are 16-member ring macrolides with antimicrotubule activity that share a similar mechanism of action to the taxanes but have demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in several different multidrug-resistant and paclitaxel-resistant tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo. it is a fully synthetic low-molecular-weight epothilone with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to tubulin and induces microtubule polymerization while stabilizing microtubules against depolymerization, which may result in the inhibition of cell division, the induction of G2/M arrest, and apoptosis. The agent is not a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and so may exhibit activity in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumors. The epothilone class of metabolites was originally isolated from the myxobacterium Solangium cellulosum.
