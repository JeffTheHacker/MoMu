it is an N-arylpiperazine that is cis-ketoconazole in which the imidazol-1-yl group is replaced by a 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl group and in which the actyl group attached to the piperazine moiety is replaced by a p-[(+-)1-sec-butyl-5-oxo-1,5-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]phenyl group. A potent P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitor, it is used as an antifungal drug for the treatment of various fungal infections, including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and sporotrichosis. It has a role as a P450 inhibitor, an EC 3.6.3.44 (xenobiotic-transporting ATPase) inhibitor and a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor. It is a member of triazoles, a dioxolane, a N-arylpiperazine, a dichlorobenzene, a cyclic ketal, a conazole antifungal drug, a triazole antifungal drug and an aromatic ether. it is a synthetic triazole agent with antimycotic properties. Formulated for both topical and systemic use, itraconazole preferentially inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in a decrease in fungal ergosterol synthesis. Because of its low toxicity profile, this agent can be used for long-term maintenance treatment of chronic fungal infections. (NCI04)
