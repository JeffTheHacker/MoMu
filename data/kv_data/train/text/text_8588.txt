1, 3, 4, 5-Tetra-O-galloylquinic acid, also known as 1, 3, 4, 5-tetragqa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-galloylquinic acids and derivatives. O-galloylquinic acids and derivatives are compounds containing a galloic acid moiety, linked to one hydroxyl group of a quinic acid moiety. 1, 3, 4, 5-Tetra-O-galloylquinic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1, 3, 4, 5-tetra-O-galloylquinic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
