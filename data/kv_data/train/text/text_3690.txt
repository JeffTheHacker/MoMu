it is a hydrochloride obtained by reaction of oxycodone with one molar equivalent of hydrochloric acid. it is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is used to treat alcohol dependence. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, an antidote to opioid poisoning and a central nervous system depressant. It contains a naltrexone(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt of naltrexone, a noroxymorphone derivative with competitive opioid antagonistic activity. Naltrexone and its metabolite 6-beta-naltrexol reverse the effects of opioids by binding to various opioid receptors in the central nervous system CNS), including the mu-, kappa- and gamma-opioid receptors; opioid effects of analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, miosis, bradycardia, and physical dependence are inhibited. Naltrexone is longer-acting and more potent compared to naloxone.
