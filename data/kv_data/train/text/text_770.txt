it is a white powder with a faint amine-like odor. Melting point 107Â°C. pH (1% solution) 4.5-5.5. Used medicinally as an antihistamine. it is the maleate salt form of pheniramine, an alkylamine derivative with antihistaminic and vasodilatory properties. it binds to histamine H1 receptors, thereby inhibiting phospholipase A2 and production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide. Subsequent lack of activation of guanylyl cyclase through nitric oxide results in decreased cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, thereby inhibiting constriction of smooth muscle tissue, and decreased capillary permeability and histamine-activated allergic reactions.
