it is a member of the class of phosphonic acids that is methylphosphonic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens has been replaced by a 2-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)ethoxy group. An inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the bis(t-butoxycarbonyloxymethyl) ester (dipivoxil ester) prodrug is used to treat chronic hepatitis B viral infection. It has a role as a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a drug metabolite, an antiviral drug, a nephrotoxic agent and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It is a member of 6-aminopurines, an ether and a member of phosphonic acids. It derives from an adenine. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor analog of adenosine with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
