it is a methoxynaphthalene that is 2-methoxynaphthalene substituted by a carboxy ethyl group at position 6. it is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the reduction of pain, fever, inflammation and stiffness caused by conditions such as osteoarthritis, kidney stones, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, bursitis, and for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. It works by inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an antipyretic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, a gout suppressant, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a drug allergen. It is a monocarboxylic acid and a methoxynaphthalene. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a propionic acid derivative and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. it inhibits the activity of the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in a decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The resulting decrease in prostaglandin synthesis is responsible for the therapeutic effects of it. it also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
