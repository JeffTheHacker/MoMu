it, also known as it or benzyl carbinyl isovalerianate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acid esters. These are carboxylic ester derivatives of a fatty acid. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 2-phenylethyl 3-methylbutanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it is a sweet, apricot, and bitter tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages and herbs and spices. This makes 2-phenylethyl 3-methylbutanoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
