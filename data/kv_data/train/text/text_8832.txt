it is a bioactive polypeptide of 39 amino acid residues isolated from the saliva of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). High-affinity glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (Kd = 136 pM); potently induces cAMP formation without stimulating amylase release in pancreatic acini; potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated rat islets; protects against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. A synthetic version is called exenatide. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, an incretin mimetic and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Exenatide is a 39 amino acid peptide and synthetic version of it, a hormone found in the saliva of the venomous lizard Gila monster, with insulin secretagogue and antihyperglycemic activity. Exenatide is administered subcutaneously and mimics human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Compared to GLP-1, exenatide has a longer half-life of 2.4 hours.
