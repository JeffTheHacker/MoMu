it is a bibenzimidazole and a N-methylpiperazine. It has a role as a fluorochrome and an anthelminthic drug. it is a fluorescent dye of benzimidazole derivative. it binds to AT-specific sites in the minor groove of duplex DNA and inhibits topoisomerase I, and DNA polymerase, thereby preventing DNA replication. This agent prolongs the G2 phase of the cell cycle and initiates apoptosis in tumor cells. (NCI04)
