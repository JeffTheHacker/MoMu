it is a synthetic glucocorticoid drug that is particularly effective as an immunosuppressant, and affects virtually all of the immune system. it is a prodrug that is converted by the liver into prednisolone (a beta-hydroxy group instead of the oxo group at position 11), which is the active drug and also a steroid. It has a role as a prodrug, an anti-inflammatory drug, an antineoplastic agent, an immunosuppressive agent and an adrenergic agent. It is a 20-oxo steroid, an 11-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. it is a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, it enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations.
