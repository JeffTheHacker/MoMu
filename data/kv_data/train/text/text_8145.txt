it is an isopropyl ester, a methyl ester, a dihydropyridine and a benzoxadiazole. it is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with antihypertensive and vasodilator activities. it blocks the calcium entry through the calcium ion channels of coronary and peripheral vascular smooth muscle, thereby dilating coronary arteries and peripheral arterioles. This increases oxygen delivery due to an increased blood flow and reduces oxygen requirements due to decrease in total peripheral resistance. (NCI05)
