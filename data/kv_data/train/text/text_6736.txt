it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02248090 (it First Time in Patients Ascending Dose Study). Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader it is an orally available selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, SERD it binds to the estrogen receptor (ER) and induces a conformational change that results in the degradation of the receptor. This prevents ER-mediated signaling and inhibits the growth and survival of ER-expressing cancer cells.
