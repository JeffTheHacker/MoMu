Methyl 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoate belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives are compounds containing a hydroxybenzoic acid (or a derivative), which is a benzene ring bearing a carboxyl and a hydroxyl groups. Methyl 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoate exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, methyl 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, methyl 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoate can be found in onion-family vegetables. This makes methyl 2, 4, 6-trihydroxybenzoate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
