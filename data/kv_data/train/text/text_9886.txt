Katononic acid, also known as katononate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Katononic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, katononic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, katononic acid can be found in fruits. This makes katononic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
