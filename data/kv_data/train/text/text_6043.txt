it is a third generation, non-sedating, selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, with antihistamine, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-angiogenic activities. it competes with endogenous histamine for binding at peripheral H1-receptor sites on the effector cell surface. This prevents the negative symptoms associated with histamine release and an allergic reaction. In addition, as histamine plays an important role in angiogenesis during an allergic inflammatory reaction, blocking the action of histamine may modulate the expression of proangiogenic factors and thus may prevent angiogenesis. As a third-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist, it has fewer side effects than most second-generation antihistamines.
