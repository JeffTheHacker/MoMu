Epoetin is a recombinant form of erythropoietin, a hematologic growth factor that induces proliferation and maturation of red blood cells and is used in the treatment of anemia caused by renal disease, myelodysplasia, cancer chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation. Epoetin and its various derivatives have not been associated with serum enzyme elevations during therapy or with instances of clinically apparent liver injury.
