it is a member of the class of benzamides obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid with the secondary amino group of 1'-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-spiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-piperidine]. Selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (pKi = 8.2). Displays >60-fold selectivity over 5-HT1D, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in radioligand binding and functional assays. Centrally active following oral administration in vivo. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an azaspiro compound, a 1,2,4-oxadiazole and a member of benzamides. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+).
