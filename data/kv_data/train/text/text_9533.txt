1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carbonitrile is a nitrile that is 1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carbonitrile in which one of the hydrogens at position 1 is replaced by a p-fluorophenyl group, while the other is replaced by a 3-(dimethylamino)propyl group. It is a member of 2-benzofurans, a nitrile, an organofluorine compound, a cyclic ether and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a 3-[5-cyano-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl]-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-aminium. it is a bicyclic phthalene derivative and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), with antidepressant and anxiolytic activities. it selectively inhibits the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in presynaptic cells in the central nervous system, thereby increasing levels of 5-HT within the synaptic cleft and enhancing the actions of serotonin on its receptors. Increased serotonergic neurotransmission results in antidepressive and anxiolytic effects.
