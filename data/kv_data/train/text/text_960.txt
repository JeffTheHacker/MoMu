it is a penicillin in which the substituent at position 6 of the penam ring is a 2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido group. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a penicillin and a penicillin allergen. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is the anhydrous form of a broad-spectrum, semisynthetic aminopenicillin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This interrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis and results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
