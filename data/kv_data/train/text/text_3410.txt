3-Methyl-4-octanolide, also known as (E)-whiskylactone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. 3-Methyl-4-octanolide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-methyl-4-octanolide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 3-Methyl-4-octanolide exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. 3-Methyl-4-octanolide is a flower and lactone tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes 3-methyl-4-octanolide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
