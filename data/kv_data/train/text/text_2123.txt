it, also known as N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as glycinamide ribonucleotides. Glycinamide ribonucleotides are compounds in which the amide N atom of glycineamide is linked to the C-1 of a ribosyl (or deoxyribosyl) moiety. Nucleotides have a phosphate group linked to the C5 carbon of the ribose (or deoxyribose) moiety. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Tetrahydrofolic acid and it can be biosynthesized from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and glycineamideribotide; which is catalyzed by the enzyme trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3. In addition, it and L-glutamine can be converted into phosphoribosylformylglycineamidine and L-glutamic acid through the action of the enzyme phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase. In humans, it is involved in the mercaptopurine action pathway, the thioguanine action pathway, the azathioprine action pathway, and the purine metabolism pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include xanthine dehydrogenase deficiency (xanthinuria), the gout or kelley-seegmiller syndrome pathway, adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, and the mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome pathway. Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as gram bean, cherry tomato, spinach, and elliott's blueberry. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
