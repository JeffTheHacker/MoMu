Ononin is a 4'-methoxyisoflavone that is formononetin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones and a 7-hydroxyisoflavones 7-O-beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a formononetin.
