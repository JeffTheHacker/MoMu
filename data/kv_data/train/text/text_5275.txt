it is a purine nucleoside analogue consisting of a 6-amino-2-chloropurin-9-yl group attached to the 1beta position of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-D-arabinofuranose. It is metabolized intracellularly to the active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits DNA synthesisis and so stops the growth of cancer cells. it is used as an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antimetabolite. It is an organofluorine compound and a member of adenosines. it is a second generation purine nucleoside analog with antineoplastic activity. it is phosphorylated intracellularly to the cytotoxic active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits the enzymatic activities of ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis of DNA and RNA. This nucleoside analog also disrupts mitochondrial function and membrane integrity, resulting in the release of pre-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome C and apoptotic-inducing factors, which activate apoptosis.
