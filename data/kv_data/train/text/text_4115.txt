Delta(1)-dihydrotestosterone is an anabolic steroid that differs from testosterone by having a 1,2-double bond instead of a 4,5-double bond in its A ring. A potent androgen with anabolic properties, it was legally sold as a prohormone in the U.S.A. until 2005, when it was reclassified as a Schedule III drug. It has a role as an anabolic agent. It is an anabolic androgenic steroid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid and a 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid.
