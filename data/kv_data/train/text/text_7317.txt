it is a recombinant version of the cardiac neurohormone, human B-type natriuretic peptide (hBNP) produced by the ventricular myocardium. it binds to natriuretic peptide receptors on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, through which it triggers guanylate cyclase dependent signal transduction resulting in increase of intracellular concentrations of cGMP. This leads to smooth muscle cell relaxation causing arterial and venous dilatation.
