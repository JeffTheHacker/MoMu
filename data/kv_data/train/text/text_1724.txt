4-Methylphenyl 3-methylbutanoate, also known as p-tolyl 3-methylbutyrate or fema 3387, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenol esters. These are aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring substituted by a hydroxyl group and an ester group. 4-Methylphenyl 3-methylbutanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-methylphenyl 3-methylbutanoate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 4-Methylphenyl 3-methylbutanoate has a sweet, animal, and herbal taste.
