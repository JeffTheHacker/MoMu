it is an odorless white solid. Sinks and mixes slowly with water. (USCG, 1999) it is a whitish, crystalline, inorganic compound that forms toxic fumes of cadmium oxides when heated. Calcium sulfate is used in electroplating, vacuum tubes, fluorescent screens, analytical chemistry, as a fungicide and as a chemical intermediate to produce cadmium containing pigments and stabilizers. Exposure to this substance irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract and causes damage to the lungs resulting in shortness of breath, chest pain and pulmonary edema, and can also damage the kidneys causing proteinuria and decreased renal function. Calcium sulfate is a known carcinogen and is associated with an elevated risk of developing lung cancer. (NCI05)
