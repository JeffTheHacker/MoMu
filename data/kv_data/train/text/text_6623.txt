it is a synthetic, yellow crystalline solid that is insoluble in water and moderately soluble in toluene. It is not used for any commercial applications and is used only for research purposes. When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. it is found in particulate emissions from combustion products, of which diesel exhaust is the principle source. The primary route of potential human exposure to this chemical is inhalation. it has been detected at low concentrations in ambient air. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
