it is a 3-oxo Delta(4)-steroid that is pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione substituted by an alpha-hydroxy group at position 17 and a methyl group at position 6. It has a role as a contraceptive drug, a progestin and a synthetic oral contraceptive. It is a 20-oxo steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. it is a synthetic derivative of progesterone administered as an acetate salt (it acetate) with antiestrogenic activity. As a do all progestins, it binds to and activates nuclear receptors which subsequently bind to and activate target genes for transcription. As an antiestrogen, this agent may inhibit the growth-stimulating effects of estrogen on estrogen-sensitive tumor cells. (NCI04)
