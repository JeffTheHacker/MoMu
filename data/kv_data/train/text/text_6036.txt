it is an N-acylsulfonamide resulting from the formal condensation of valdecoxib with propionic acid. It is a prodrug for valdecoxib. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a prodrug. It is a member of isoxazoles and a N-sulfonylcarboxamide. It derives from a valdecoxib. it is an amide prodrug of the cyclooxygenase II (COX-2) selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) valdecoxib, with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Upon administration, it is hydrolyzed by hepatic carboxyesterases to its active form, valdecoxib. Valdecoxib selectively binds to and inhibits COX-2. This prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are involved in the regulation of pain, inflammation, and fever. This NSAID does not inhibit COX-1 at therapeutic concentrations and, therefore, does not interfere with blood coagulation.
