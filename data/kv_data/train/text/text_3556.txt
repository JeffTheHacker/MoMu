Nonanoyl-CoA belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl coas. These are acyl-CoAs carrying a 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl chain. Nonanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Nonanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, nonanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
