it is a lipid-permeable tacrolimus analogue and a protein dimerizer. It was designed to overcome limitations of current cellular immunotherapies used for cancer and other blood disorders by enhancing the control of the immune cell activity and function. When administered via chemically-inducible dimerization (CID) technologies, it binds to switch proteins and dimerizes them, triggering downstream signaling cascade. The combination use of it with immunotherapies for enhanced therapeutic effectiveness is currently under investigation. it is a lipid-permeable tacrolimus analogue with homodimerizing activity. Dimerizer drug it homodimerizes an analogue of human protein FKBP12 (Fv) which contains a single acid substitution (Phe36Val) so that it binds to wild-type FKBP12 with 1000-fold lower affinity. This agent is used to homodimerize the Fv-containing drug-binding domains of genetically engineered receptors such as the iCD40 receptor of the autologous dendritic cell vaccine BP-GMAX-CD1, resulting in receptor activation.
