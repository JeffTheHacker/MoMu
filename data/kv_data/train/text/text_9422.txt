it is a stilbenol that is stilbene in which the phenyl groups are substituted at positions 3, 5, and 4' by hydroxy groups. It has a role as a phytoalexin, an antioxidant and a glioma-associated oncogene inhibitor. It is a stilbenol, a polyphenol and a member of resorcinols. it is a phytoalexin derived from grapes and other food products with antioxidant and potential chemopreventive activities. it induces phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (anti-initiation activity); mediates anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase functions (anti-promotion activity); and induces promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation (anti-progression activity), thereby exhibiting activities in three major steps of carcinogenesis. This agent may inhibit TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (NCI05)
