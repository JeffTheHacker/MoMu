it is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid that is testosterone bearing a methyl group at the 17alpha position. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an anabolic agent and an androgen. It is a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid and an enone. It derives from a testosterone. it is a methylated synthetic androgen receptor agonist with anabolic effects. it, mimicking testosterone, binds to cytosolic androgen receptors, and the subsequent nuclear transfer of the ligand-receptor complex induces transcription initiation of androgen responsive genes. The gene products are responsible for normal growth and development of male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics. The agent also causes retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, as well as calcium.
