Carnosic acid, also known as carnosate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpenoids. These are terpene compounds formed by four isoprene units. Carnosic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, carnosic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
