it is an optically active form of 4-it having L-trans-configuration. It has a role as a human metabolite, a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a tautomer of a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline zwitterion. it is a nonessential amino acid derivative formed during post-translational protein modification through hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase which requires vitamin C as a co-factor. it is a major component of the protein collagen and plays a key role in the stability of the collagen triple helix. It can be used as an indicator to determine the amount of collagen. Increased it levels in the urine and/or serum are normally associated with degradation of connective tissue. Vitamin C deficiency decreases the conversion of proline to it, which leads to reduced collagen stability.
