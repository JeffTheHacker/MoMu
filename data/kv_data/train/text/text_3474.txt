When in contact with water or steam it may produce additional fumes that can cause illness from inhalation. The primary hazard is the threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment. Since it is a liquid it can easily penetrate the soil and contaminate groundwater and nearby streams.
