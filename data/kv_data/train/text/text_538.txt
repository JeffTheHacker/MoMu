it is a hydrobromide. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, a vasoconstrictor agent and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It contains an eletriptan(1+). it is a triptan with specific affinity for the 5-hydroxytriptamine1B/1D receptor. it binds to and acts at serotonin 5-HT1B receptors located on intracranial blood vessels which leads to vasoconstriction. This drug may also exerts its effects by binding to and activating 5-HT 1D receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system, which results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. it is used to relieve pain or symptoms associated with migraine headaches.
