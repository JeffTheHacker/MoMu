12, 14-Nonacosanedione belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta-diketones. These are organic compounds containing two keto groups separated by a single carbon atom. 12, 14-Nonacosanedione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 12, 14-nonacosanedione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 12, 14-nonacosanedione can be found in fats and oils. This makes 12, 14-nonacosanedione a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
