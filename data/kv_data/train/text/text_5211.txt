it is a dioxo monocarboxylic acid that consists of hydrindane bearing two oxo substituents at positions 1 and 5, a methyl substituent at position 7a and a 2-carboxyethyl substituent at position 4 (3aS,4S,7aS-diastereomer). It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a diketone, a dioxo monocarboxylic acid and a carbobicyclic compound. It is a conjugate acid of a 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oate.
