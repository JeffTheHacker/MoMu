it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzimidazoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring (five member ring containing a nitrogen atom, 4 carbon atoms, and two double bonds). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in eggs. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
