it is a ginsenoside found in Panax ginseng and Panax japonicus var. major that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 6alpha, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy group at position 6 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a beta-D-glucoside, a disaccharide derivative, a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a 20-hydroxy steroid and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
