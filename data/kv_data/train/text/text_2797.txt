Betadex, also known as beta-cyclodextrin or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligosaccharides. These are carbohydrates made up of 3 to 10 monosaccharide units linked to each other through glycosidic bonds. Betadex exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, betadex is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Betadex has an odorless taste.
