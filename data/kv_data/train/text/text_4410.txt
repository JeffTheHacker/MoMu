it appears as a white crystalline solid. Obtained by neutralizing the base hydrazine with sulfuric acid. it is the synthetic sulfate salt of hydrazine, a derivative of ammonia. Hydrazine inhibits the enzyme phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, thereby blocking gluconeogenesis. This agent has been reported to decrease the excessive energy needs and cachexia of cancer patients. Classified as a likely human carcinogen, it is also a weak inhibitor of mono-amine oxidase (MAO).
