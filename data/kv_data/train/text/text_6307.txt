it is an organofluorine compound that is haloperidol in which the hydroxy group has been eliminated with the introduction of a double bond in the piperidine ring, and the 4-chlorophenyl group has been replaced by a benzimidazol-2-on-1-yl group. It is used in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and in conjunction with an opioid analgesic such as fentanyl to maintain the patient in a calm state of neuroleptanalgesia with indifference to surroundings but still able to cooperate with the surgeon. It has a role as an antiemetic, a dopaminergic antagonist, a first generation antipsychotic and an anaesthesia adjuvant. It is a member of benzimidazoles, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ketone. it is a butyrophenone with anti-emetic, sedative and anti-anxiety properties. Although the exact mechanism through which it exerts its effects is unknown, it may block dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), which may lead to its anti-emetic effect. This agent may also bind to postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which increases the inhibitory effect of GABA and leads to sedative and anti-anxiety activities.
