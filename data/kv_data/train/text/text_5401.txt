it is an imidazole derivative and broad-spectrum antimycotic agent with fungistatic properties. it inhibits biosynthesis of ergosterol, thereby damaging the fungal cell wall membrane and altering its permeability which leads to a loss of essential intracellular components. In addition, it inhibits biosynthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids and inhibits oxidative and peroxidative enzyme activity which may contribute to cellular necrosis and cell death. it is also active against some gram positive bacteria. This antifungal agent is used in the treatment various dermatomycoses.
