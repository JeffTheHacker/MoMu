it (anhydrous) is the anhydrous form of the tripotassium salt of citric acid. It has a role as a diuretic. It contains a citrate(3-). it is the potassium salt form of citrate with alkalinizing property. Following absorption, it causes increased plasma bicarbonate concentration, thereby raising blood and urinary pH. A simultaneous decrease in calcium ion activity occurs as a result of increasing calcium complex formation with dissociated anions. Levels of urinary citrate are increased due to modification of the renal handling of citrate. By promoting excretion of free bicarbonate ion and by increasing urinary pH in addition to an increased ionization of uric acid to more soluble urate ions, this agent exerts the alkalizing and anti-urolithic effect.
