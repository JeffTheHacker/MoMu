Trimethylsilyl N-pentadecanoic acid, also known as N-pentanoate, trimethylsilyl ester, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trimethylsilyl esters. These are organoheterosilanes, bearing a silicon atom that is linked to three methyl groups and is O-esterified. Trimethylsilyl N-pentadecanoic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Trimethylsilyl N-pentadecanoic acid has been primarily detected in feces.
