(-)-it, also known as L-pinocarveol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as bicyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing exactly 2 rings, which are fused to each other (-)-it exists as a liquid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (-)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (-)-it can be found in a number of food items such as sweet bay, common sage, cumin, and hyssop. This makes (-)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
