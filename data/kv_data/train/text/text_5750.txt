Methyl-3-methylthioproprionate, also known as methyl 3-(methylthio)propanoic acid or fema 2720, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methyl esters. These are organic compounds containing a carboxyl group that is esterified with a methyl group. They have the general structure RC(=O)OR', where R=H or organyl group and R'=methyl group. Methyl-3-methylthioproprionate is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, methyl-3-methylthioproprionate is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Methyl-3-methylthioproprionate exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Methyl-3-methylthioproprionate is a sweet, garlic, and onion tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages and fruits. This makes methyl-3-methylthioproprionate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
