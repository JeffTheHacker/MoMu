it is a glycine derivative having methyl and amidino groups attached to the nitrogen. It has a role as a neuroprotective agent, a nutraceutical, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a member of guanidines and a glycine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of a itate. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is an endogenous amino acid derivative produced by vertebrate animals and occurring primarily in muscle cells. it is important for energy storage; it is phosphorylated to it phosphate, which serves as a phosphate donor in the conversion of ADP to ATP and supplies energy necessary for muscle contraction. Dietary supplementation with it may improve muscle wasting associated with cancer and other chronic diseases.
