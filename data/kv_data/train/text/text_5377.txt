it, also known as gly-pro, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been detected in most biofluids, including urine, cerebrospinal fluid, feces, and blood. Within the cell, glycylproline is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it has been found to be associated with the diseases known as alzheimer's disease; glycylproline has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including prolidase deficiency.
