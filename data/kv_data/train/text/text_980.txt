it is an N-substituted diamine that is pentane-1,4-diamine substituted by a 6-methoxyquinolin-8-yl group at the N(4) position. It is a drug used in the treatment of malaria and Pneumocystis pneumonia. It has a role as an antimalarial. It is an aminoquinoline, a N-substituted diamine and an aromatic ether. it is a synthetic, 8-aminoquinoline derivative with antimalarial properties. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, it bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA. This agent eliminates tissue (exo-erythrocytic) malarial infection, preventing the development of the erythrocytic forms of the parasite which are responsible for relapses in Plasmodium vivax and ovale malaria. it is active against late hepatic stages (hypnozoites, schizonts). (NCI04) it Phosphate is the phosphate salt form of it, a synthetic, 8-aminoquinoline derivative with antimalarial properties. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, it bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA. This agent eliminates tissue (exo-erythrocytic) malarial infection, preventing the development of the erythrocytic forms of the parasite which are responsible for relapses in Plasmodium vivax and ovale malaria. it is active against late hepatic stages (hypnozoites, schizonts).
