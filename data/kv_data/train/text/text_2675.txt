it is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2E,6R)-6-hydroxyhept-2-enoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). A metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is weakly dauer inducing and a weak male-attractant. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite and a pheromone. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (2E,6R)-6-hydroxyhept-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-).
