it, also known as isocaprylate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains between 4 and 12 carbon atoms. it exists as a liquid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, isocaprylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome. Outside of the human body, isocaprylic acid can be found in alcoholic beverages and fats and oils. This makes isocaprylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
