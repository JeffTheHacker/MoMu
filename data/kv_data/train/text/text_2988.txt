it, also known as dihydrojasmonate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as jasmonic acids. These are lipids containing or derived from a jasmonic acid, with a structure characterized by the presence of an alkene chain linked to a 2-(3-oxocyclopentyl)acetic acid moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in broad bean, cereals and cereal products, pulses, and rye. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
