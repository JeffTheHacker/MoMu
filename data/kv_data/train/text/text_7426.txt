it is a lipophilic, nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with anti-anginal and antihypertensive activities. it competitively binds to and blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, thereby decreasing cardiac contractility and rate. This leads to a reduction in cardiac output and lowers blood pressure. In addition, it prevents the release of renin, a hormone secreted by the kidneys that causes constriction of blood vessels.
