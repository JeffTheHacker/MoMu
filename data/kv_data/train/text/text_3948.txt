it is an organosulfur heterocyclic compound that is 1,5-oxathiocane which has been substituted at the 2-pro-R, 3, 6, and 8 positions by oxo, acetamido, 5,6-dihydropyridin-2(1H)-ylidene, and (2E)-but-2-enoyl groups, respectively, and which has been dehydrogenated to introduce a double bond at the 7-8 position. It was isolated from Streptomyces coelicolor M145 after genetically engineered increase of the metabolic flux and is the product of a polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a lactone, an enone, a member of acetamides, a dihydropyridine, an organosulfur heterocyclic compound and an enamine. It derives from a hydride of a 1,5-oxathiocane.
