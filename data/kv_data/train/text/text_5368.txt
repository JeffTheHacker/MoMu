it is a dipeptide derivative which is used which is in combination with dasabuvir sodium hydrate, paritaprevir and ritonavir (under the trade name Viekira Pak) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection as well as cirrhosis of the liver. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor. It is a member of pyrrolidines, a carbamate ester, an aromatic amide and a dipeptide. It derives from a Val-Pro. it is an orally available inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) replication complex, with potential activity against HCV. Upon oral administration and after intracellular uptake, it binds to and blocks the activity of the NS5A protein. This results in the disruption of the viral RNA replication complex, blockage of HCV RNA production, and inhibition of viral replication. NS5A, a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein, plays a crucial role in HCV RNA replication. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family; HCV infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
