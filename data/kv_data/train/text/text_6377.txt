it is the hydrochloride salt form of prilocaine, an intermediate-acting local anesthetic of the amide type chemically related to lidocaine. it binds to voltage-gated sodium ion channels in the neuronal membrane, thereby preventing the permeability of sodium ions. This leads to a stabilization of the neuronal membrane and inhibits depolarization and results in a reversible blockage of nerve impulse generation and propagation along nerve fibres and subsequent reversible loss of sensation.
