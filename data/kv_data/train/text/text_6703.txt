it, also known as 1-(methyldisulfanyl)ethane or 2, 3-dithiapentane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkyldisulfides. These are organic compounds containing a disulfide group R-SS-R' where R and R' are both alkyl groups. Within the cell, methyl ethyl disulfide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a sulfurous and truffle tasting compound that can be found in fruits, kohlrabi, and onion-family vegetables. This makes methyl ethyl disulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
