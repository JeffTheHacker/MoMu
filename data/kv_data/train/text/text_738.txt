it is a steroid ester that is betamethasone in which the hydroxy group at the 17alpha position has been converted to the corresponding pentanoate ester. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a steroid ester, a 20-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a fluorinated steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a betamethasone. it is the 17-valerate ester of betamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid with metabolic, immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions. it binds to specific intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently binds to DNA to modify gene expression. The synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins is induced while the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators is inhibited. As a result, there is an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions.
