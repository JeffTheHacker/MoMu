it, anhydrous appears as a colorless gas with a fishlike odor at low concentrations changing to ammonia-like odor at higher concentrations. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite from evaporative cooling or chemical type burns. The gasis corrosive and dissolves in water to form flammable, corrosive solutions. Gas is an asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. Prolonged exposure to heat can cause the containers to rupture violently and rocket. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations or short -term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects. it is a tertiary amine that is ammonia in which each hydrogen atom is substituted by an methyl group. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a tertiary amine and a member of methylamines. It is a conjugate base of a trimethylammonium.
