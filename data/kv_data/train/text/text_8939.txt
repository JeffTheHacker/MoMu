it is a member of morpholines, an anthracycline antibiotic, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a doxorubicin. it is a morpholinyl analogue of the anthracycline doxorubicin with antineoplastic activity. it is metabolized via the P450 CYP3A enzyme to a highly cytotoxic derivative. Unlike most anthracyclines, it is a topoisomerase I inhibitor and appears to exert its effect through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. In addition, this agent does not show cross-resistance with other anthracyclines.
