it is a pyridinethione that is pyridine-2(1H)-thione in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a hydroxy group. It is a Zn(2+) ionophore; the zinc salt is used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent. It has a role as an ionophore. It is a pyridinethione and a monohydroxypyridine. It is a tautomer of a pyridine-2-thiol N-oxide. it is a fungistatic and antimicrobial derivative of aspergillic acid. Although the exact mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated, it appears to interfere with membrane transport ultimately leading to a loss of metabolic control.
