Demethylated antipyrine, also known as edarabone or methylphenylpyrazolone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpyrazoles. Phenylpyrazoles are compounds containing a phenylpyrazole skeleton, which consists of a pyrazole bound to a phenyl group. Demethylated antipyrine exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, demethylated antipyrine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
