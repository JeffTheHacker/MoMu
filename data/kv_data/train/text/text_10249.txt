it is the methanesulfonic acid salt of dihydroergotamine, a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid with weaker oxytocic and vasoconstrictor properties than ergotamine. Both the mesylate and the tartrate salts are used for the treatment of migraine and orthostatic hypotension. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, a non-narcotic analgesic and a vasoconstrictor agent. It contains a dihydroergotamine. it is an ergot derivative with agonistic activity for alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic receptors. it most likely relieves migraine headaches by binding to and stimulating the 5-HT1D receptor subtype, thereby causing constriction of cerebral blood vessels. However, it has also been proposed that it acts upon 5-HT1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system, thereby decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.
