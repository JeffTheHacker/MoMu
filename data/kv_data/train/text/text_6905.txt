it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains between 4 and 12 carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), cytoplasm and adiposome. Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in fruits. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
