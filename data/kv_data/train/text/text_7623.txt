1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine hydrochloride monohydrate appears as yellow needles (from concentrated hydrochloric acid); white powder. pH of 1.5% solution: 4.5-6. Bitter taste. (NTP, 1992) it is the hydrochloride salt form of tacrine, an aminoacridine derivative with cognitive stimulating property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it may bind reversibly to cholinesterase, acetylcholinesterase as well as butyrylcholinesterase, thereby decreasing the breakdown of acetylcholine, and prolonging synaptic actions as well as increased release of acetylcholine. In addition, this agent inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) and may inhibit the reuptake of catecholamines and serotonin. Finally, a novel mechanism of action studied in animal models suggests tacrine to attenuate the production of interleukin-1beta in the hippocampus and blood, thereby producing central and peripheral anti-inflammatory effects that may play a role in Alzheimer's disease.
