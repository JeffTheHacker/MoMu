Starch, Corn is a starch derived from corn grain and used as food or food ingredient, with potential anti-hypoglycemic activity. Upon ingestion, corn starch is broken down and releases glucose in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Glucose is taken up in the bloodstream and maintains as well as stabilizes glucose levels. This may prevent or improve hypoglycemia in patients with glycogen storage disease or insulinomas.
