it is a member of the class of pyranoindolizinoquinolines that is the carbamate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of [1,4'-bipiperidine]-1'-carboxylic acid with the phenolic hydroxy group of (4S)-4,11-diethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1H-pyrano[3',4':6,7]indolizino[1,2- hydrochloride]quinoline-3,14-dione. Used (in the form of its hydrochloride salt trihydrate) in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. It is converted via hydrolysis of the carbamate linkage to its active metabolite, SN-38, which is ~1000 times more active. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a prodrug. It is a pyranoindolizinoquinoline, a N-acylpiperidine, a carbamate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a tertiary amino compound, a delta-lactone and a ring assembly. It derives from a SN-38. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, a cytotoxic, quinoline-based alkaloid extracted from the Asian tree Camptotheca acuminata. it, a prodrug, is converted to a biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) by a carboxylesterase-converting enzyme. One thousand-fold more potent than its parent compound it, SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptotic cell death. Because ongoing DNA synthesis is necessary for it to exert its cytotoxic effects, it is classified as an S-phase-specific agent.
