it is a member of the class of oxindoles that is a kinase inhibitor used (in the form of its ethylsulfonate salt) for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, a fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonist and an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is an aromatic ester, a methyl ester, a member of oxindoles, an enamine, an aromatic amine, an aromatic amide and a N-alkylpiperazine. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is an orally bioavailable, indolinone-derived inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs), with potential antiangiogenic, antifibrotic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, it selectively binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) tyrosine kinases, which may result in the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis, the reduction in tumor vasculature, the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and migration, and antifibrotic activity in pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, it also binds to and inhibits members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, including Src, Lck and Lyn, and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3). VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and CSF1R RTKs play key roles in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and metastasis, as well as pulmonary fibrosis.
