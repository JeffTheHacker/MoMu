it is a 30-membered homodetic cyclic peptide comprising the sequence D-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Arg-Glu-Val-Leu-Glu-Nle-Ala-Arg-Ala-Glu-Gln-Leu-Ala-Gln-Glu-Ala-His-Lys-Asn-Arg-Lys-Leu-Nle-Glu-Ile-Ile-NH2 cyclised by an amide bridge, formed by condensation of the side-chain carboxy group of the Glu residue at position 19 and the side-chain amino group of the Lys residue at position 22. It has a role as a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist and a neuroprotective agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a polypeptide.
