Beta-(2-Methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anisoles. These are organic compounds containing a methoxybenzene or a derivative thereof. Beta-(2-Methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Beta-(2-Methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, Beta-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
