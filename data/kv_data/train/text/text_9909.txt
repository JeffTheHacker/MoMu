it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxazolidinones. Oxazolidinones are compounds containing an oxazolidinone moiety, which is an oxazolidine bearing a ketone group. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-isoxazolidinone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3-isoxazolidinone can be found in pulses. This makes 3-isoxazolidinone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
