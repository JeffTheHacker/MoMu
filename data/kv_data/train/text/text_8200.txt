it is a non-steroidal 3rd generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that selectively binds to both ERÎ± and ERÎ² with high affinity. It is a naphthalene derivative marketed for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. It was initially developed as it by Pfizer as a treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis and vaginal atrophy, in which were both rejected for approval by FDA. Later Fablyn was developed as a result of a research collaboration between Pfizer and Ligand Pharmaceuticals with a newly submitted New Drug Application in 2008. It gained approval by European Commission in March 2009. Ligand Pharmaceuticals signed a license agreement with Sermonix Pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of oral it in the USA. it is a non-steroidal, naphthalene-derived, third-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with potential antineoplastic and anti-osteoporotic activities. Upon oral administration, it selectively binds to both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha; ESR1) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta; ESR2) with high affinity and mimics the effects of endogenous estradiol with varying agonist and antagonist effects in ER-expressing tissues. Blockade of ERalpha by it may potentially inhibit estrogen-dependent cancer cell proliferation in ER-expressing cancers. it may also bind to the certain mutant forms of ERalpha, including the Y537S ESR1 mutant, making it potentially useful in the treatment of tumors that have acquired resistance to other ER-targeting agents.
