(Â±)-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkylthiols. These are organic compounds containing the thiol functional group linked to an alkyl chain (Â±)-it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (Â±)-it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (Â±)-it can be found in fruits. This makes (Â±)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
