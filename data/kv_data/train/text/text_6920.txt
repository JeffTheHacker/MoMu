it is a purine arabinonucleoside monophosphate having 2-fluoroadenine as the nucleobase. A prodrug, it is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. Once incorporated into DNA, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP functions as a DNA chain terminator. It is used for the treatment of adult patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have not responded to, or whose disease has progressed during, treatment with at least one standard alkylating-agent containing regimenas. It has a role as an antimetabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an immunosuppressive agent, an antiviral agent, a prodrug and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It is an organofluorine compound, a nucleoside analogue and a purine arabinonucleoside monophosphate. It derives from a 2-fluoroadenine. it is the phosphate salt of a fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity. it is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite may inhibit DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thereby interrupting DNA synthesis and inhibiting tumor cell growth.
