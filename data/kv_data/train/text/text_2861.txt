5-Hydroxy capric acid, also known as sodium it or 5-hydroxy caprate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains between 4 and 12 carbon atoms. 5-Hydroxy capric acid is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). 5-Hydroxy capric acid has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 5-hydroxy capric acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm and adiposome. Outside of the human body, 5-hydroxy capric acid can be found in milk and milk products. This makes 5-hydroxy capric acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
