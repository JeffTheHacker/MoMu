Ce(5:0) belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cholesteryl esters. Cholesteryl esters are compounds containing an esterified cholestane moiety. Ce(5:0) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Ce(5:0) has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, ce(5:0) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
