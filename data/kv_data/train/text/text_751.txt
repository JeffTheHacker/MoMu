Isopropyl methoxypyrazine, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxypyrazines. These are pyrazines containing a methoxyl group attached to the pyrazine ring. Isopropyl methoxypyrazine is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, isopropyl methoxypyrazine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Isopropyl methoxypyrazine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Isopropyl methoxypyrazine is a beany, earthy, and pea tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as pepper (c. annuum), orange bell pepper, green bell pepper, and fishes. This makes isopropyl methoxypyrazine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
