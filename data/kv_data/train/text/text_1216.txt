Ginsenoside RD, also known as gypenoside VIII, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Ginsenoside RD exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ginsenoside RD is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, ginsenoside RD can be found in tea. This makes ginsenoside RD a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
