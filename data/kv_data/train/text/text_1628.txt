it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as (s)-3-hydroxyacyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a (S)-3-hydroxyl acylated coenzyme A derivative. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, it is involved in the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. it is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase deficiency type I, the methylmalonic aciduria pathway, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria pathway.
