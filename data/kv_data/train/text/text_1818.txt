3-Methylthio-thiophene, also known as 3-thienylmethylsulfide or methyl 3-thienyl sulfide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aryl thioethers. These are organosulfur compounds containing a thioether group that is substituted by an aryl group. 3-Methylthio-thiophene is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 3-methylthio-thiophene is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). 3-Methylthio-thiophene exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans.
