it has been used in trials studying the treatment and prevention of Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, and Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. it binds to and inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby inhibiting the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. it-mediated inhibition of COX-2 may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. COX-related metabolic pathways may represent crucial regulators of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.
