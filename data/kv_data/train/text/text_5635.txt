it appears as a white crystalline solid. Melting point 218Â°C. Used as an antineoplastic. it is a vinca alkaloid with formula C46H56N4O10 found in the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus. It is used (commonly as the corresponding sulfate salt)as a chemotherapy drug for the treatment of leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, breast cancer and head and neck cancer. It has a role as a tubulin modulator, a microtubule-destabilising agent, a plant metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a drug. It is a methyl ester, an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a member of formamides, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a vinca alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a vincristine(2+). It derives from a hydride of a vincaleukoblastine. it is a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. it binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.
