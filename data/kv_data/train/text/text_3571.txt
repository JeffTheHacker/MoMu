it is a monocarboxylic acid that is a propionic acid derivative having a 4,5-diphenyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl substituent at position 3. It is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to relieve the pain and inflammatory responses associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an analgesic. It is a member of 1,3-oxazoles and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a propionic acid. it is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derivative of oxazole-propionic acid with analgesic and antipyretic properties. As a first generation NSAID inhibitor, it binds to and inactivates both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and-2), thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. When inhibiting COX-2, this agent may be effective in relieving pain and inflammation; when inhibiting COX-1, it may produce unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects. (NCI04)
