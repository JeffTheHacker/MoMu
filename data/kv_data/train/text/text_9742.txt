it is a member of the class of 1-benzothiophenes that is 1-benzothiophene in which the hydrogens at positions 2, 3, and 6 have been replaced by p-hydroxyphenyl, p-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]benzoyl, and hydroxy groups, respectively. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent, an estrogen receptor modulator and an estrogen antagonist. It is a member of phenols, an aromatic ketone, a member of 1-benzothiophenes and a N-oxyethylpiperidine. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a selective benzothiophene estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). it binds to estrogen receptors (ER) as a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist; it displays both an ER-alpha-selective partial agonist/antagonist effect and a pure ER-beta-selective antagonist effect. This agent functions as an estrogen agonist in some tissues (bones, lipid metabolism) and as an estrogen antagonist in others (endometrium and breasts), with the potential for producing some of estrogen's beneficial effects without producing its adverse effects.
