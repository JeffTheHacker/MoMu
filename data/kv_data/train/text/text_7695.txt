it, also known as 2-it or 2-furfurylthiol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-furanmethanethiol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a burnt, chocolate, and coffee tasting compound that can be found in cereals and cereal products, coffee and coffee products, and fats and oils. This makes 2-furanmethanethiol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
