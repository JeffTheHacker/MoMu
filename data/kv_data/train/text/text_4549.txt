Tanabalin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diterpene lactones. These are diterpenoids containing a lactone moiety. Tanabalin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, tanabalin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, tanabalin can be found in herbs and spices and tea. This makes tanabalin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
