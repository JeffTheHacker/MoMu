it is a broad-spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of actinobacteria. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antibacterial drug, an antiprotozoal drug, a protein synthesis inhibitor and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a member of its. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-) and a it zwitterion. it is a broad-spectrum naphthacene antibiotic produced semisynthetically from chlorit, an antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces aureofaciens. In bacteria, it binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, interferes with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis.
