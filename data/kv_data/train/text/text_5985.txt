it is a benzazepine and a tetracyclic antidepressant. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a histamine antagonist, an anxiolytic drug, a H1-receptor antagonist and a oneirogen. it is a synthetic tetracyclic derivative of the piperazino-azepines with antidepressant activity. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, it enhances central adrenergic and serotonergic transmission, possibly by acting as an antagonist at central presynaptic alpha 2 adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors. This agent is a potent antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT2), 5-HT3, and histamine 1 (H1) receptors, and a moderate antagonist of peripheral alpha 1 adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
