it, a benzoyl mustard derivative of distamycin A, is an alkylating agent that binds to the minor groove of DNA. It's association with severe myelotoxicity lead to the end of its development in favour of Î±-halogenoacrylamide derivatives such as [brostallicin], which have a favourable cytotoxicity/myelotoxicity ratio. Newer generations of DNA minor groove binding agents can more specifically recognize base pair sequences. it is a benzoyl mustard derivative of the antiviral agent distamycin A with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to A-T rich regions in the minor groove of DNA and alkylates at the N3 position of adenine in a highly sequence-specific manner. This prevents DNA replication, inhibits cellular proliferation and triggers apoptosis. Moreover, unlike other clinical nitrogen mustards, it does not carry out guanine-N7 alkylation in the major groove of DNA, which may lead to a high selectivity of action.
