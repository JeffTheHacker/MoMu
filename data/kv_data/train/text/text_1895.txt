it is a triazolo-benzodiazepine derivative with sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities. it binds to the benzodiazepine binding site on the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to an increase in the opening of chloride channels, membrane hyperpolarization and increases the inhibitory effect of GABA on the CNS.
