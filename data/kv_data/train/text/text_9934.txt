2-(2-Hydroxy-3, 4-dimethoxy-6-{[3, 4, 5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy}cyclohexylidene)acetonitrile belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. 2-(2-Hydroxy-3, 4-dimethoxy-6-{[3, 4, 5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy}cyclohexylidene)acetonitrile is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa).
