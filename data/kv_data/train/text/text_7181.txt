it is a potent and specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) it was approved in China by the SFDA in June, 2011 and in January 2014, Beta Pharma, Inc. was given a âMay Proceedâ from the US FDA to conduct a Phase I study for the evaluation of it as a treatment of EGFR+ Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). it is an orally available quinazoline-based inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits the wild-type and several mutated forms of EGFR tyrosine kinase. This may lead to an inhibition of EGFR-mediated signal transduction and may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types.
