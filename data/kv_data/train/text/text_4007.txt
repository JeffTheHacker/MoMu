it, also known as Î-terpineol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in a number of food items such as herbs and spices, spearmint, common sage, and rosemary. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
