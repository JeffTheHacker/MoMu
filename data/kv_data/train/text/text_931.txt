(1XI, 4XI, 6XI)-Carvone oxide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxepanes. Oxepanes are compounds containing an oxepane ring, which is a seven-member saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one oxygen and six carbon atoms (1XI, 4XI, 6XI)-Carvone oxide is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (1xi, 4xi, 6xi)-carvone oxide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (1xi, 4xi, 6xi)-carvone oxide can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (1xi, 4xi, 6xi)-carvone oxide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
