it is a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative, with antimycobacterial activity. Upon oral administration, it, a prodrug, is activated via the mycobacterial F420 coenzyme system to form a reactive intermediate metabolite that inhibits the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall components methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. This leads to the depletion of these cell wall components and destruction of mycobacteria.
