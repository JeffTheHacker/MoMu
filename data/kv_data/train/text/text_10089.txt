5-tert-Butyl-2,4,6-trinitro-m-xylene is a white to light-colored crystalline solid. It is insoluble in water and denser than water. Hence sinks in water. Contact may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. May be toxic by ingestion. Used to make other chemicals. it is a C-nitro compound that is m-xylene bearing three nitro substituents at positions 2, 4 and 6 as well as a tert-butyl group at position 5. It has a role as an explosive, a fragrance and a carcinogenic agent. It derives from a 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and a m-xylene.
