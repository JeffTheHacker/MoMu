it atom is the radioactive isotope of oxygen with relative atomic mass 15.003065. The longest-lived oxygen radionuclide with half-life of 122.2 s. it is an inert, radiopharmaceutical of it (O-15) labeled water used as a tracer molecule with positron emission tomography (PET). Upon administration, water O-15 is freely diffusible and its distribution, as well as its clearance, are completely dependent on the rate of blood flow. it can be imaged using PET to measure tissue or tumor blood flow/perfusion. This cyclotron product has a very short half life of about 2 minutes thereby allowing for multiple, serial measurements.
