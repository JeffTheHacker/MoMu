it is a substituted aniline that is 3-aminophenol in which the hydrogens of the amino group are replaced by 4-methylphenyl and 4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-ylmethyl groups respectively. An alpha-adrenergic antagonist, it is used for the treatment of hypertension. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and a vasodilator agent. It is a member of imidazoles, a member of phenols, a tertiary amino compound and a substituted aniline. it is a synthetic imidazoline with alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity. As a competitive alpha-adrenergic antagonist, it binds to alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, resulting in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilatation. This agent also may block 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and stimulate release of histamine from mast cells.
