it, also known as a-amyrone or 12-ursen-3-one, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Alpha-amyrone is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, Alpha-amyrone can be found in black elderberry, fruits, rosemary, and shea tree. This makes Alpha-amyrone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
