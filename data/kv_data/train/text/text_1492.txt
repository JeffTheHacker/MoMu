Stearoyl-CoA, also known as octadecanoyl-CoA or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain fatty acyl coas. These are acyl CoAs where the group acylated to the coenzyme A moiety is a long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms. Stearoyl-CoA is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Stearoyl-CoA has been found in human adipose tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, stearoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm, membrane (predicted from logP), mitochondria and peroxisome. In humans, stearoyl-CoA is involved in plasmalogen synthesis pathway. Stearoyl-CoA is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the mitochondrial Beta-oxidation OF long chain saturated fatty acids pathway.
