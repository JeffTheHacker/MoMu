it is a member of the class of quinazolines that is 4-amino-7-methoxyquinazoline in which the amino group has been substituted by a 3-chloro-2-fluorophenyl group and in which position 6 of the quinoline ring has been substituted by a {1-[2-(methylamino)-2-oxoethyl]piperidin-4-yl}oxy group. it is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFR) HER2 and HER3. It has a role as an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist and an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of quinazolines, a member of piperidines, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an aromatic ether, a secondary amino compound and a tertiary amino compound. it is an erbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. erbB kinase inhibitor it binds to and inhibits erbB tyrosine receptor kinases, which may result in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis in tumors expressing erbB. The erbB protein family, also called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, plays major roles in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.
