it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as elemane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the elemane skeleton. Elemane is a monocyclic compound consisting of a cyclohexane ring substituted with a methyl group, an ethyl group, and two 1-methylethyl groups at the 1-, 1-, 2-, and 4-position, respectively. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices and root vegetables. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
