Tetradecanoyl-CoA , also known as myristoyl-CoA or N-C14:0CoA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as long-chain fatty acyl coas. These are acyl CoAs where the group acylated to the coenzyme A moiety is a long aliphatic chain of 13 to 21 carbon atoms. Tetradecanoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Tetradecanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, tetradecanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Tetradecanoyl-CoA exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, tetradecanoyl-CoA is involved in the Beta oxidation OF very long chain fatty acids pathway, the adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked pathway, and the fatty acid metabolism pathway. Tetradecanoyl-CoA is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(14:0/22:6(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z)/14:1(9Z)) pathway, de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(14:0/20:5(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z)/20:3(5Z, 8Z, 11Z)) pathway, de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(14:0/18:3(6Z, 9Z, 12Z)/22:5(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z)) pathway, and de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis TG(i-21:0/14:0/a-17:0) pathway. Outside of the human body, tetradecanoyl-CoA can be found in a number of food items such as maitake, orange bell pepper, spinach, and gram bean. This makes tetradecanoyl-CoA a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
