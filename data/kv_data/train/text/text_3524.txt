it is an azaspiro compound that consists of 1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decan-4-one having a phenyl group attached to N-1 and a 3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl attached to N-8. Selective 5-HT antagonist, which binds to 5-HT2 sites as potently as spiperone but has lower affinity for 5-HT2C receptors. Also a high affinity D2 receptor antagonist (Ki = 3 nM). Lacks the disruptive effect of spiperone on animal behaviour. It has a role as a dopaminergic antagonist and a serotonergic antagonist. It is an azaspiro compound, an organofluorine compound, an aromatic ether, a tertiary amino compound and a member of piperidines.
