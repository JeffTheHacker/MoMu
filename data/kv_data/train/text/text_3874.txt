it is an organofluorine compound. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic. It derives from a methoxyethane. it is a fluorinated ether with general anesthetic and muscle relaxant activities. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been established, it, administered by inhalation, appears to act on the lipid matrix of the neuronal membrane, resulting in disruption of neuronal transmission in the brain.
