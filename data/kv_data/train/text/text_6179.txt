it is an Insulin Analog. The chemical classification of it is Insulin. Insulin Glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog with long-acting, blood glucose-lowering activity. it, like regular types of human insulin, regulates glucose metabolism by binding to insulin receptors on muscle and fat cells, thereby facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose. This lowers blood glucose levels. At the same time, it inhibits the liver's conversion of stored glycogen into glucose, which also contributes to lower blood glucose levels. it also inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.
