it is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/gamma agonist which improves apolipoprotein levels in non-diabetic subjects with insulin resistance. it is a proposed treatment for type 2 diabetes and has completed several phase III clinical trials, however in May 2006 AstraZeneca announced that they had discontinued further development. it is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, with hypoglycemic activity. it is more potent on the gamma subtype than on the alpha subtype of PPAR. This agent improves atherogenic dyslipidemia but may cause an increase in fibrosarcoma formation.
