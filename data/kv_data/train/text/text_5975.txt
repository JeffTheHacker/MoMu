belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ketones. These are organic compounds in which a carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms R2C=O (neither R may be a hydrogen atom). Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. Thus, is considered to be an oxygenated hydrocarbon lipid molecule. is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). has a citrus and fatty taste.
