Psi-pelletierine, also known as granatan-3-one or N-methylgranatonine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as piperidinones. Piperidinones are compounds containing a piperidine ring which bears a ketone. Psi-pelletierine exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, psi-pelletierine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, psi-pelletierine can be found in fruits and pomegranate. This makes psi-pelletierine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
