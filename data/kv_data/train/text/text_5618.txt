it is a synthetic analog of bradykinin. it is a potent, specific bradykinin B-2 receptor agonist that stimulates B-2 receptors expressed on the surface of brain capillary endothelial cells, thereby reversibly increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Compared to bradykinin, this agent possesses enhanced receptor selectivity, greater plasma stability, and a longer half-life. (NCI04)
