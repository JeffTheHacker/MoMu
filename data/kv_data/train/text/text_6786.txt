Defibrotide is a complex mixture of single stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine intestinal mucosa that has antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activity and is used in the treatment of severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Defibrotide is used in patients with severe liver injury and has not been associated with worsening of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent, idiosyncratic liver injury. it is a polydeoxyribonucleotide with antithrombotic, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic properties. Defibrotide induces the release of prostaglandin 12 and reduces the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, thereby interfering with platelet and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. (NCI04) Defibrotide is a mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the intestinal mucosa of pigs, with anti-thrombotic, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic activities. Upon administration, and although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, defibrotide induces the release of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), E2 (PGE2), and prostacyclin and reduces the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. This relaxes the smooth muscle of blood vessels and prevents platelets from adhering to each other and to the endothelium. This protects the endothelium lining bloods vessels. Defibrotide increases tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity. This increases the activity of plasmin, prevents blood clot formation and dissolves blood clots.
