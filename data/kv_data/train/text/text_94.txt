it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid c-glycosides. Flavonoid C-glycosides are compounds containing a carbohydrate moiety which is C-glycosidically linked to the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid backbone. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, maysin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, maysin can be found in cereals and cereal products and corn. This makes maysin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
