it is a C-glycosyl compound that is 4-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide in which the hydrogen at position 3 has been replaced by a beta-D-ribofuranosyl group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an EC 4.1.1.23 (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase) inhibitor and an antimicrobial agent. It is a C-glycosyl compound and a member of pyrazoles. It derives from a beta-D-ribose. it is a nucleoside analog. it potently inhibits orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase, thereby interfering with de novo synthesis of uridine nucleotides and resulting in cytotoxicity. This agent also causes a rapid depletion of the pyrimidine deoxynucleotide pool, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and cell replication. (NCI04)
