it is an organic bromide salt having (1alpha,2beta,4beta,5alpha,7beta)-7-[(hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0(2,4)]nonane as the counterion. Used (in the form of the hydrate) for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent and a muscarinic antagonist. It is an organic bromide salt and a quaternary ammonium salt. it is the bromide salt form of tiotropium, a quaternary ammonium derivative of atropine and a muscarinic receptor antagonist, with bronchodilating activity. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, on topical application, it acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands, preventing smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion, thus producing a bronchodilatory effect.
