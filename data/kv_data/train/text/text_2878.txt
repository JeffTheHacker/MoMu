it is a hydrochloride salt resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of diltiazem and hydrogen chloride. A calcium-channel blocker and vasodilator, it is used in the management of angina pectoris and hypertension. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a vasodilator agent and a calcium channel blocker. It contains a diltiazem(1+). It is an enantiomer of an ent-it. Diltiazem Hydrochloride is a benzothiazepine calcium channel blocking agent. it inhibits the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium ions into select myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, causing dilatation of coronary and systemic arteries and decreasing myocardial contractility. Because of its vasodilatory activity, this agent has been shown to improve the microcirculation in some tumors, thereby potentially improving the delivery of antineoplastic agents to tumor cells.
