it is a hydrochloride that is the monohydrochloride of 5-aminolevulinic acid. It is metabolised to protoporphyrin IX, a photoactive compound which accumulates in the skin. Used in combination with blue light illumination for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratosis of the face or scalp. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a photosensitizing agent, a dermatologic drug and a prodrug. It contains a 5-ammoniolevulinic acid. it is the hydrochloride salt form of aminolevulinic acid, an aminoketone, used for local photosensitizing therapy. Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a metabolic pro-drug that is converted into the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which accumulates intracellularly. Upon exposure to light of appropriate wavelength (red, or blue), PpIX catalyzes oxygen to singlet oxygen, an intracellular toxin, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. This leads to cellular cytotoxic effects.
