it is a member of the class of pyrazolopyrimidines that is the ethyl ester of 2-[(diethoxyphosphorothioyl)oxy]-5-methylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid. A profungicide (by hydrolysis of the thionophosphate group to afford the corresponding 2-hydroxypyrazolopyrimidine fungicide), it is used to control Erysiphe, Helminthosporium and Rhynchospium in cereals. It has a role as a phospholipid biosynthesis inhibitor, an insecticide, an antifungal agrochemical and a profungicide. It is a pyrazolopyrimidine, an organic thiophosphate and an ethyl ester. It derives from an ethyl 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate.
