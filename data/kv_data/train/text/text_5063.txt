it is a member of the classo of biphenyls that is the amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-methyl-4'-(trifluoromethoxy)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 6-(2,6-dimethylmorpholin-4-yl)pyridin-3-amine. Used (as its phosphate salt) for treatment of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a SMO receptor antagonist and a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor. It is a member of morpholines, an aminopyridine, a member of biphenyls, a member of benzamides, an aromatic ether, an organofluorine compound and a tertiary amino compound. it is an orally bioavailable small-molecule smoothened (Smo) antagonist with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to the hedgehog (Hh)-ligand cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of the Hh signaling pathway and, so, the inhibition of tumor cells in which this pathway is abnormally activated. The Hh signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair. Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation, as is observed in a variety of cancers, may be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo.
