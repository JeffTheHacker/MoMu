1-D-it is a conduritol epoxide resulting from the formal epoxidation of the double bond of (+)-conduritol B. It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.48 (sucrose alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor and an EC 3.2.1.10 (oligo-1,6-glucosidase) inhibitor. It derives from a (+)-conduritol B. It is an enantiomer of a 1-L-it.
