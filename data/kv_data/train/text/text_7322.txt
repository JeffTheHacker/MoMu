9-Azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan-3-one, also known as alpha-phosphinylbenzyl alcohol or granatonine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as piperidinones. Piperidinones are compounds containing a piperidine ring which bears a ketone. 9-Azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan-3-one exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 9-azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan-3-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 9-azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan-3-one can be found in fruits and pomegranate. This makes 9-azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan-3-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
