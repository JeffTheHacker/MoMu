Bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide, also known as 3, 3'-dithiobis(2-methyl-furan or fema 3259, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heteroaromatic compounds. Heteroaromatic compounds are compounds containing an aromatic ring where a carbon atom is linked to an hetero atom. Bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide is a meaty, onion, and roasted tasting compound that can be found in tea. This makes bis-(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
