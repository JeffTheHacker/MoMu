it is 1H-imidazole substituted at C-1 by a (2-ethylsulfonyl)ethyl group, at C-2 by a methyl group and at C-5 by a nitro group. It is used as an antiprotozoal, antibacterial agent. It has a role as an antiprotozoal drug, an antibacterial drug and an antiparasitic agent. it is a 5-nitroimidazole derivative with antiprotozoal property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it has been suggested that it is metabolized and yields nitrite anions and metronidazole. Metronidazole's nitro group in turn is reduced via the parasite ferredoxin, thereby generating a series of free nitro radicals including nitro anions. Toxicity is achieved via depletion of sulfhydryl groups and DNA strand breaks with multiple hits having an additive effect and ultimately leading to cell death.
