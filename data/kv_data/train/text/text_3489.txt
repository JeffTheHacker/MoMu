it appears as cream-colored needles (from pyridine) or yellow powder. Odorless. (NTP, 1992) it is an organic heterotetracyclic compound resulting from the formal dimerisation of gallic acid by oxidative aromatic coupling with intramolecular lactonisation of both carboxylic acid groups of the resulting biaryl. It is found in many fruits and vegetables, including raspberries, strawberries, cranberries, and pomegranates. It has a role as an antioxidant, a food additive, a plant metabolite, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor, an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor, an EC 2.3.1.5 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) inhibitor, an EC 2.4.1.1 (glycogen phosphorylase) inhibitor, an EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione transferase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.1.127 (inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.1.151 (inositol-polyphosphate multikinase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.4.6 (nucleoside-diphosphate kinase) inhibitor, a skin lightening agent, a fungal metabolite and an EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a cyclic ketone, a lactone, a member of catechols and a polyphenol. It derives from a gallic acid. Pomegranate Juice is a natural juice isolated from the fruit of the plant Punica granatum with antioxidant, potential antineoplastic, and chemopreventive activities. Pomegranate juice contains flavonoids which promote differentiation and apoptosis in tumor cells by down-regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stimulating migration inhibitory factor (MIF), thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. The flavonoids in pomegranate juice also scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, in some cell types, may prevent ROS-mediated cell injury and death. (NCI04)
