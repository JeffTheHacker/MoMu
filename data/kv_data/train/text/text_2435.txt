3-Acetyl-1, 2-dithiolane, also known as 1, 2-dithiolane, 3-acetyl, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1, 2-dithiolanes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-dithiolane ring. 1, 2-dithiolane moiety is a 5-membered saturated aliphatic ring with three carbon atoms, and two sulfur atoms at the 1- and 2- ring positions. 3-Acetyl-1, 2-dithiolane is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-acetyl-1, 2-dithiolane is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
