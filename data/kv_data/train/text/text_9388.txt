(+)-4, 11-Eudesmadien-3-one, also known as eudesma-4, 11-dien-3-one, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as eudesmane, isoeudesmane or cycloeudesmane sesquiterpenoids. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the eudesmane skeleton (+)-4, 11-Eudesmadien-3-one is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (+)-4, 11-eudesmadien-3-one is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (+)-4, 11-eudesmadien-3-one can be found in root vegetables. This makes (+)-4, 11-eudesmadien-3-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
