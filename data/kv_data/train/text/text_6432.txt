it is an organic sodium salt which is the tetrasodium salt of eritoran. It contains an eritoran(4-). it is the tetrasodium salt of a synthetic analogue of the lipid A portion of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with potential immunomodulating activity. Eritoran binds to the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/CD14/MD2 receptor complex present on most cells of the immune system, inhibiting the activation of the receptor complex by LPS, which may result in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). LPS is found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and binds to the TLR/CD14/MD2 receptor complex of immune cells, especially macrophages, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
