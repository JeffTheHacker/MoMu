Hexamethyl-p-rosaniline chloride is a green to dark green powder. (NTP, 1992) it is an organic chloride salt that is the monochloride salt of it cation. It has been used in creams for the topical treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, being effective against some Gram-positive bacteria (notably Staphylococcus species) and some pathogenic fungi (including Candida species) but use declined following reports of animal carcinogenicity. It has also been used for dying wood, silk, and paper, as well as a histological stain. It has a role as a histological dye, an antiseptic drug, an antibacterial agent, an antifungal agent and an anthelminthic drug. It contains a it cation. it is a blue, aniline-derived dye with antifungal and antimitotic properties. it (GV) dissociates into positive (GV+) and negative ions (Cl-) that penetrate both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cells. The GV+ ions interact with negatively charged components of the bacterial cell wall including lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and DNA. This agent is also a mutagen and mitotic poison. GV elicits a photodynamic action mediated by a free-radical mechanism. Furthermore, this agent dissipates the action potential on prokaryotic or eukaryotic membranes by inducing permeability, thereby leading to respiratory inhibition and subsequent cell death.
