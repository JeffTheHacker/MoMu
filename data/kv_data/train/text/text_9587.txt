1-(2-Furanylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole, also known as 1-(2-furfuryi)pyrrole or 1H-pyrrole, 1-(2-furfuryl), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as substituted pyrroles. These are heterocyclic compounds containing a pyrrole ring substituted at one or more positions. 1-(2-Furanylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1-(2-furanylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 1-(2-Furanylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole is a coffee, fruity, and green tasting compound that can be found in alcoholic beverages, cereals and cereal products, coffee and coffee products, and nuts. This makes 1-(2-furanylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
