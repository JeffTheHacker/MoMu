Leu-leu-leu, also known as trileucine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligopeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of between three and ten alpha-amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Leu-leu-leu is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Leu-leu-leu has been primarily detected in feces.
