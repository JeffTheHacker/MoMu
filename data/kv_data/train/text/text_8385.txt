it is a tertiary amine. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist, a muscle relaxant and an antispasmodic drug. It derives from a p-cresol. it is a benzhydryl compound and a muscarinic receptor antagonist possessing both antimuscarinic and antispasmodic properties. Both it and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethylit, competitively blocks muscarinic receptors, thereby inhibiting acetylcholine binding. This antagonistic action results in an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure, indicating an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite appears to contribute significantly to the therapeutic effects.
