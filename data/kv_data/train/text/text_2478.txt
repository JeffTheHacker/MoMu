it is a beta-D-glucoside, a furonaphthodioxole and an organic heterotetracyclic compound. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It derives from a podophyllotoxin and a 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin. it is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic properties, it binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II and its function in ligating cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of single- or double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, and apoptotic cell death. it acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle.
