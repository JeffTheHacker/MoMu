Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, also known as neohesperidin DC or E959, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid o-glycosides. Flavonoid O-glycosides are compounds containing a carbohydrate moiety which is O-glycosidically linked to the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid backbone. Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone is a bland tasting compound that can be found in sweet orange. This makes neohesperidin dihydrochalcone a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
