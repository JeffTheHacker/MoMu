it is a member of the class of aminopyrimidines that is 4-(1-methylindol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine in which one of the amino hydrogens is replaced by a 2-methoxy-4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl](methyl)amino-5-acrylamidophenyl group. Used (as the mesylate salt) for treatment of EGFR T790M mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist. It is a member of indoles, an aminopyrimidine, a biaryl, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound, a monomethoxybenzene, a member of acrylamides, a substituted aniline and a secondary carboxamide. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is a third-generation, orally available, irreversible, mutant-selective, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, it covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. it preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGFR.
