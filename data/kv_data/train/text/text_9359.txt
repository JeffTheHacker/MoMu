it is a very long-chain fatty acid that is docosa-10,16-dienoic acid which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18 and 20, by hydroxy groups at positions 11, 19 and 21, and by a (2',5-dimethyloctahydro-2,2'-bifuran-5-yl)ethanol group at position 21. An ionophore produced by Streptomyces conglobatus, it is used in research to raise the intracellular level of Ca(2+) and as a research tool to understand Ca(2+) transport across biological membranes. It has a role as a metabolite and a calcium ionophore. It is an enol, a cyclic ether, a very long-chain fatty acid and a polyunsaturated fatty acid.
