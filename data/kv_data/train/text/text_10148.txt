it is a mesylate salt form of trioxifene, a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Trioxifene competitively inhibits the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), resulting in ER alpha-mediated gene expression. Clinical development of Trioxifene has not proceeded because of lack of superior results over tamoxifen and side effect profile. (NCI)
