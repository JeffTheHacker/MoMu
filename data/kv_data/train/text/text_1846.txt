4-[2, 3-Diethyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)oxiran-2-yl]phenol, also known as diethylstilbestrol alpha, alpha'-epoxide, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. 4-[2, 3-Diethyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)oxiran-2-yl]phenol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
