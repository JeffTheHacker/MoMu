it is a pteridine that is the N-4-[1-(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-yl)pent-4-yn-2-yl]benzoyl derivative of L-glutamic acid. Used for treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite and an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor. It is a N-acyl-L-glutamic acid, a member of pteridines and a terminal acetylenic compound. it is a folate analogue inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) exhibiting high affinity for reduced folate carrier-1 (RFC-1) with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities. it selectively enters cells expressing RFC-1; intracellularly, this agent is highly polyglutamylated and competes for the folate binding site of DHFR, blocking tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which may result in depletion of nucleotide precursors; inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; and apoptotic tumor cell death. Efficient intracellular polyglutamylation of it results in higher intracellular concentrations compared to non-polyglutamylated it, which is more readily effuxed by the MRP (multidrug resistance protein) drug efflux pump. RFC-1, an oncofetal protein expressed at highest levels during embryonic development, may be over-expressed on the cell surfaces of various cancer cell types.
