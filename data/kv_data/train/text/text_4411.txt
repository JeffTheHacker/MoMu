Mitindomide is a bisdioxopiperazines analog with antineoplastic activity. Mitinomide inhibits topoisomerase II and slowly promotes DNA-interstrand cross-linking, thereby inhibiting DNA repair, RNA and protein synthesis. This agent acts without increasing topoisomerase II-DNA covalent cleavable complex formation, as do most topoisomerase inhibitors. (NCI04)
