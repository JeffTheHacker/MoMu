it, also known as hydroxynalidixate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthyridine carboxylic acids and derivatives. Naphthyridine carboxylic acids and derivatives are compounds containing a naphthyridine moiety, where one of the ring atoms bears a carboxylic acid group. it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, hydroxynalidixic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
