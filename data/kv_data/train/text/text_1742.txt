Androstan-3alpha, 17beta-diol, also known as 5Î±-androstan-3Î±, 17Î²-diol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as androgens and derivatives. These are 3-hydroxylated C19 steroid hormones. They are known to favor the development of masculine characteristics. They also show profound effects on scalp and body hair in humans. Androstan-3alpha, 17beta-diol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Androstan-3alpha, 17beta-diol has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, androstan-3alpha, 17beta-diol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm.
