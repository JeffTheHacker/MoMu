S-(2, 5-Dimethyl-3-furanyl) 2-furancarbothioate, also known as 3(2-furoylthio)-2, 5-dimethylfuran or 2, 5-dimethyl-3-(2-thiofuroyl)furan, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as furoic acid and derivatives. These are aromatic heterocyclic compounds containing a furan ring, which carries a carboxyl group or a derivative thereof. S-(2, 5-Dimethyl-3-furanyl) 2-furancarbothioate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, S-(2, 5-dimethyl-3-furanyl) 2-furancarbothioate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). S-(2, 5-Dimethyl-3-furanyl) 2-furancarbothioate has a vegetable taste.
