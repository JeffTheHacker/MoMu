3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA, also known as dhca, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl coas. These are acyl-CoAs carrying a 2, 3, 4-saturated fatty acyl chain. 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, 3a, 7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisome and cytoplasm. 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA can be biosynthesized from 3a, 7a-dihydroxycoprostanic acid through the action of the enzyme bile acyl-CoA synthetase. In addition, 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA can be converted into 3a, 7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA; which is catalyzed by the enzyme Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In humans, 3a, 7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA is involved in congenital bile acid synthesis defect type III pathway, congenital bile acid synthesis defect type II pathway, bile acid biosynthesis pathway, and the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) pathway. 3a, 7a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA is also involved in a few metabolic disorders, which include the familial hypercholanemia (fhca) pathway, the zellweger syndrome pathway, and 27-hydroxylase deficiency.
