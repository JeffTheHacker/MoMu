it is a cephalosporin bearing {[1-(sulfomethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]sulfanyl}methyl and (R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetamido groups at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the cephem skeleton. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a conjugate acid of a it(2-). it is a second-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
