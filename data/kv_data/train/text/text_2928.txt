it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 8-o-methylated flavonoids. These are flavonoids with methoxy groups attached to the C8 atom of the flavonoid backbone. Thus, demethylnobiletin is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, demethylnobiletin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, demethylnobiletin can be found in a number of food items such as herbs and spices, peppermint, winter savory, and citrus. This makes demethylnobiletin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
