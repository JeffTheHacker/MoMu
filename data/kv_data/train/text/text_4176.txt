(Â±)-it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as toluenes. Toluenes are compounds containing a benzene ring which bears a methane group (Â±)-it is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (Â±)-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (Â±)-it can be found in green vegetables. This makes (Â±)-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
