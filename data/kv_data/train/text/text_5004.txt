a-Methyldopamine, also known as catecholamphetamine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as amphetamines and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing or derived from 1-phenylpropan-2-amine. a-Methyldopamine is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). a-Methyldopamine has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, a-methyldopamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
