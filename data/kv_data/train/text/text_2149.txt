Molybdenum, also known as Mo, belongs to the class of inorganic compounds known as homogeneous transition metal compounds. These are inorganic compounds containing only metal atoms, with the largest atom being a transition metal atom. Molybdenum has been found in human brain tissue, and has also been primarily detected in saliva, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, molybdenum is primarily located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. In humans, molybdenum is involved in the sulfate/sulfite metabolism pathway. Molybdenum is also involved in the metabolic disorder called sulfite oxidase deficiency. Molybdenum is a potentially toxic compound.
