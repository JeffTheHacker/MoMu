it is a furonaphthodioxole that is 4'-demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin which is substituted at position 4 of the C-ring by a 2-{[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl](methyl)amino}ethyl group. While structurally related to etoposide, it is significantly more toxic to non-small cell lung cancer cells, more active at generating chromosomal breaks, and displays improved cellular uptake and pharmacokinetics in animal lung tissues. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a furonaphthodioxole, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound, a member of phenols and a gamma-lactone.
