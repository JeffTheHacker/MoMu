3-Methoxy-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzoic acid, also known as 5-methoxypiperonylic acid or myristicic acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gallic acid and derivatives. Gallic acid and derivatives are compounds containing a 3, 4, 5-trihydroxybenzoic acid moiety. 3-Methoxy-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzoic acid exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3-methoxy-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3-methoxy-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzoic acid can be found in green vegetables. This makes 3-methoxy-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
