6alpha-[(R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-2-[(R)-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]pen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid is a it. It is a conjugate acid of a 6alpha-[(R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-2-[(R)-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]pen-2-em-3-carboxylate. it is a penem with a tetrahydrofuran substituent at position C2, with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. Compared with imipenem, it has improved chemical stability and reduced central nervous system effects. In addition, it is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases.
