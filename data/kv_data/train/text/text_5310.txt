it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as guaianes. These are sesquiterpenoids with a structure based on the guaiane skeleton. Guaiane is a bicyclic compound consisting of a decahydroazulene moiety, substituted with two methyl groups and a 1-methylethyl group at the 1-, 4-, and 7-position, respectively. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in mushrooms. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
