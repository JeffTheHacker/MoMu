it is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively inhibits IGF-1R, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, IGF-1R stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis.
