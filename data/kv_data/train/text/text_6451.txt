it appears as odorless or practically odorless white to off-white crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a monocarboxylic acid that is butanoic acid substituted by an amino group at position 4 and a 4-chlorophenyl group at position 3. It acts as a central nervous system depressant, GABA agonist and muscle relaxant. It has a role as a muscle relaxant, a central nervous system depressant and a GABA agonist. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a primary amino compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a gamma-amino acid. it is a synthetic chlorophenyl-butanoic acid derivative used to treat spasms due to spinal cord damage and multiple sclerosis, muscle-relaxing it acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist specific for GABA-B receptors. It acts at spinal and supraspinal sites, reducing excitatory transmission. (NCI04)
