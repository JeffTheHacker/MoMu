it is a man-made radioactive chemical. it has no naturally occurring or stable isotopes. Two important isotopes of americium are americium 241 (241it) (read as americium two-forty-one) and 243it. Both isotopes have the same chemical behavior in the environment and the same chemical effects on your body. 241it is used in ionization smoke detectors. There is no broad commercial use for 243it. Nuclear reactors, nuclear explosions, or the radioactive transformation of plutonium can produce both 241it and 243it. These isotopes transform by giving off alpha radiation and turning into radionuclides of other elements. The half-life of a radioactive material is the time it takes for half of the material to give off its radiation. The half-life of 241it is 432 years and that of 243it is 7,370years. it atom is an actinoid atom and a f-block element atom. it is a man-made radioactive element with atomic symbol it, atomic number 95, and atomic weight 243.
