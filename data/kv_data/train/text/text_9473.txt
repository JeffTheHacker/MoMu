it has been investigated for the treatment of Colorectal Cancer. it is the alaninate salt of a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Brivanib strongly binds to and inhibits VEGFR2, a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed almost exclusively on vascular endothelial cells; inhibition of VEGFR2 may result in inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, inhibition of tumor cell growth, and tumor regression.
