it appears as crystalline solid or very light yellow powder. (NTP, 1992) it is a hydrochloride obtained by combining amiloride with one molar equivalent of hydrochloric acid. It has a role as a diuretic and a sodium channel blocker. It contains an amiloride(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt of amiloride, a synthetic pyrazine derivative with antikaliuretic and diuretic properties. Amiloride inhibits sodium channels located in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, thereby preventing the absorption of sodium and increasing its excretion along with water, to produce naturesis. In response to the hypernatremic conditions in the kidney, the plasma membrane becomes hyperpolarized and electrochemical forces are reduced, which then prevents the excretion of potassium and hydrogen into the lumen.
