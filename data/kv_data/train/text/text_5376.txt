it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside compound having 5-fluorouracil as the nucleobase; used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an antiviral drug and a radiosensitizing agent. It is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside, an organofluorine compound and a nucleoside analogue. it is a fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analogue of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) with antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, it inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. This agent is also metabolized to fluorouracil and other metabolites that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. (NCI04)
