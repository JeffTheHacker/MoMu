it is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas. It will support life. It is noncombustible, but will actively support the burning of combustible materials. Some materials that will not burn in air will burn in oxygen. Materials that burn in air will burn more vigorously in oxygen. As a non-liquid gas it is shipped at pressures of 2000 psig or above. Pure oxygen is nonflammable. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. it is used in the production of synthesis gas from coal, for resuscitation and as an inhalant. Dioxygen is a diatomic oxygen, a gas molecular entity and an elemental molecule. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug, a reagent, a nutrient, a micronutrient, an oxidising agent, a human metabolite, a member of food packaging gas and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a hydridodioxygen(1+). it is an element with atomic symbol it, atomic number 8, and atomic weight 16.
