T2 Toxin, also known as fusariotoxin T 2 or T 2 toxin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trichothecenes. These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzopyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetyl, or other substituents. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12, 13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain. T2 Toxin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, T2 toxin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). T2 Toxin is a potentially toxic compound.
