Penicillin g, sodium salt is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder with a faint odor. pH (10% solution) 5.5-7.5. (NTP, 1992) it is an organic sodium salt. It contains a benzylpenicillin(1-). it is the sodium salt form of benzylpenicillin, a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic with bactericidal activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
