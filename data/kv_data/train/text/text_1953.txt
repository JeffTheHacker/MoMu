Pentagastrin, also known as peptavlon, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hybrid peptides. Hybrid peptides are compounds containing at least two different types of amino acids (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) linked to each other through a peptide bond. Pentagastrin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Pentagastrin has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, pentagastrin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
