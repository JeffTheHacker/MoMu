it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oxepanes. Oxepanes are compounds containing an oxepane ring, which is a seven-member saturated aliphatic heterocycle with one oxygen and six carbon atoms. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in fats and oils, herbs and spices, and tea. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
