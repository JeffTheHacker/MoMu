it, also known as S-1-methylethyl 3-methylbut-2-enethioate or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fatty acyl thioesters. These are thioester derivatives of a fatty acid with the general formula RC(=O)SR', where R is the fatty acyl chain. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, S-isopropyl 3-methylbut-2-enethioate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. it has an alliaceous, galbanum, and green taste.
