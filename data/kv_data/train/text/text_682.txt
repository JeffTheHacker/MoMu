it is the dihydrochloride salt of cefotiam. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It contains a cefotiam. Cefotiam Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of cefotiam, a third-generation, semi-synthetic, beta-lactam cepitin antibiotic with antibacterial activity. Cefotiam binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases that are responsible for crosslinking of peptidoglycan. By preventing crosslinking of peptidoglycan, cell wall integrity is lost and cell wall synthesis is halted.
