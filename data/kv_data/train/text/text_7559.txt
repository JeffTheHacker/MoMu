(4S, 6S)-3, 4, 5, 6-Tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one belongs to the class of organic compounds known as delta valerolactones. These are cyclic organic compounds containing an oxan-2- one moiety (4S, 6S)-3, 4, 5, 6-Tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (4S, 6S)-3, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (4S, 6S)-3, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one can be found in root vegetables. This makes (4S, 6S)-3, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
