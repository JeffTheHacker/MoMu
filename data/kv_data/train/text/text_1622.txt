it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 2-phenylethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2-phenylethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside can be found in alcoholic beverages, fruits, green vegetables, and herbs and spices. This makes 2-phenylethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
