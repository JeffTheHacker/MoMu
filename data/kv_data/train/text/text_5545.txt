it is an odorless white to cream-colored crystalline solid. Bitter taste followed by tingling sensation. (NTP, 1992) it is a member of the class of psoralens that is 7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one in which the 9 position is substituted by a methoxy group. It is a constituent of the fruits of Ammi majus. Like other psoralens, trioxsalen causes photosensitization of the skin. It is administered topically or orally in conjunction with UV-A for phototherapy treatment of vitiligo and severe psoriasis. It has a role as a dermatologic drug, an antineoplastic agent, a photosensitizing agent, a cross-linking reagent and a plant metabolite. It is a member of psoralens and an aromatic ether. It derives from a psoralen. it is a naturally occurring substance isolated from the seeds of the plant Ammi majus with photoactivating properties. As a member of the family of compounds known as psoralens or furocoumarins, it's exact mechanism of action is unknown; upon photoactivation, it has been observed to bind covalently to and crosslink DNA.
