it is the simplest member of the class of its that is 7H-furo[3,2-g]chromene having a keto group at position 7. It has been found in plants like Psoralea corylifolia and Ficus salicifolia. It has a role as a plant metabolite. it is a it that intercalates with DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis and cell division. it is used in Photochemotherapy with high-intensity long-wavelength UVA irradiation. its are tricyclic furocumarins and have a strong tendency to intercalate with DNA base pairs. Irradiation of nucleic acids in the presence of it with long wave UV (~360 nm) results in the 2+2 cyclo- addition of either of its two photoreactive sites with 5,6-carbon bonds of pyrimidines resulting in crosslinking double-stranded nucleic acids.
