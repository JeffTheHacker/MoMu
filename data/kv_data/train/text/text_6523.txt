6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil appears as odorless white crystalline powder of starch-like appearance. Bitter taste. Saturated solution is neutral or slightly acid to litmus. (NTP, 1992) it is a pyrimidinethione consisting of uracil in which the 2-oxo group is substituted by a thio group and the hydrogen at position 6 is substituted by a propyl group. It has a role as an antithyroid drug, a carcinogenic agent, an antimetabolite, a hormone antagonist, an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor, an antioxidant and an antidote to paracetamol poisoning. It derives from a uracil. it is a thiourea derivative with antithyroid property. it (PTU) interferes with the oxidation of iodine possibly by interaction with peroxidase or a peroxidase-mediated complex reaction, thereby inhibiting synthesis of thyroid hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). In addition, this agent inhibits the Type I 5'-deiodinase (D1), an enzyme involved in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine. This results in decreased plasma triodothyronine concentrations and decreased entrance of thyroxine into cells thereby reducing thyroid hormone activity.
