it, also known as 3-(methylthio)propanal, 9CI or di-et acetal, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as acetals. Acetals are compounds having the structure R2C(OR')2 ( R' not Hydrogen) and thus diethers of geminal diols. Originally, the term was confined to derivatives of aldehydes (one R = H), but it now applies equally to derivatives of ketones (neither R = H ). Mixed acetals have different R' groups. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it has a cabbage and pungent taste.
