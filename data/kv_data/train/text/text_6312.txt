(2S, 4R)-p-Mentha-1(7), 8-dien-2-ol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes (2S, 4R)-p-Mentha-1(7), 8-dien-2-ol is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (2S, 4R)-p-mentha-1(7), 8-dien-2-ol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (2S, 4R)-p-mentha-1(7), 8-dien-2-ol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (2S, 4R)-p-mentha-1(7), 8-dien-2-ol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
