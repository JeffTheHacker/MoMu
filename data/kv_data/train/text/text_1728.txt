(1XI, 3XI)-1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, also known as mtca, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as harmala alkaloids. Harmala alkaloids are compounds with a structure based on harmaline, harmine, harmalol, harman or a derivative of those parents. These parents are beta-carbolines, consisting of a pyrimidine fused to the pyrrole moiety of an indole to form a pyrido[3, 4-b]indole (1XI, 3XI)-1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, (1xi, 3xi)-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (1xi, 3xi)-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid can be found in alcoholic beverages, fruits, herbs and spices, and mushrooms. This makes (1xi, 3xi)-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
