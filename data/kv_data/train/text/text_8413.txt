it is a hydrochloride resulting from the formal reacton of equimolar amounts of hydrogen chloride and amorolfine. An inhibitor of the action of squalene monooxygenase, Delta(14) reductase and D7-D8 isomerase and an antifungal agent, it is used for the topical treatment of fungal nail and skin infections. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.132 (squalene monooxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 5.3.3.5 (cholestenol Delta-isomerase) inhibitor and an EC 1.3.1.70 (Delta(14)-sterol reductase) inhibitor. It is a hydrochloride and a morpholine antifungal drug. It contains an amorolfine(1+). it is the hyrochloride salt form of amorolfine, a morpholine antifungal agent. Amorolfine inhibits delta-14-reductase and delta-7,8-isomerase, which depletes ergosterol and causes ignosterol to accumulate in the fungal cytoplasmic cell membrane.
