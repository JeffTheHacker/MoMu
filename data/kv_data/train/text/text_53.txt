it is a hydrate that is the monohydrate of dasatinib. It is used for the treatment of chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Note that the name 'dasatinib' is used to refer to the monohydrate (USAN) as well as to anhydrous dasatinib (INN). It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It contains a dasatinib (anhydrous). Dasatinib is an orally bioavailable synthetic small molecule-inhibitor of SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinases. Dasatinib binds to and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of these kinases. Apparently because of its less stringent binding affinity for the BCR-ABL kinase, dasatinib has been shown to overcome the resistance to imatinib of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells harboring BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutations. SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinases interact with a variety of cell-surface receptors and participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways; tumorigenic forms can occur through altered regulation or expression of the endogenous protein and by way of virally-encoded kinase genes.
