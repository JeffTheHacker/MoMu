2, 3, 4-Trimethylhexane belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched alkanes. These are acyclic branched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2. 2, 3, 4-Trimethylhexane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 3, 4-trimethylhexane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 3, 4-trimethylhexane can be found in fats and oils. This makes 2, 3, 4-trimethylhexane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
