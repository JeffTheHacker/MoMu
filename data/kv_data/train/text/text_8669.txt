5-Methoxy-8, 17-dioxatetracyclo[8. 7. 0. 0Â², â·. 0Â¹Â¹, Â¹â¶]heptadeca-2(7), 3, 5, 11(16), 12, 14-hexaene-13, 14-diol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pterocarpans. These are benzo-pyrano-furano-benzene compounds, containing the 6H-[1]benzofuro[3, 2-c]chromene skeleton. They are derivatives of isoflavonoids. 5-Methoxy-8, 17-dioxatetracyclo[8. 7. 0. 0Â², â·. 0Â¹Â¹, Â¹â¶]heptadeca-2(7), 3, 5, 11(16), 12, 14-hexaene-13, 14-diol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
