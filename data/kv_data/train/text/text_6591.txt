it is a member of the class of benzotriazines that is 1,2,4-benzotriazine carrying an amino substituent at position 3 and two oxido substituents at positions 1 and 4. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and an antibacterial agent. It is a N-oxide, a member of benzotriazines and an aromatic amine. It derives from a 1,2,4-benzotriazine. it is a benzotriazine di-N-oxide with potential antineoplastic activity. it is selectively activated by multiple reductases to form free radicals in hypoxic cells, thereby inducing single-and double-strand breaks in DNA, base damage, and cell death. This agent also sensitizes hypoxic cells to ionizing radiation and inhibits the repair of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks via inhibition of topoisomerase II. (NCI04)
