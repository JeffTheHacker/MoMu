trans-p-Menth-2-ene-1, 4-diol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes. trans-p-Menth-2-ene-1, 4-diol exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, trans-p-menth-2-ene-1, 4-diol is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, trans-p-menth-2-ene-1, 4-diol can be found in herbs and spices. This makes trans-p-menth-2-ene-1, 4-diol a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
