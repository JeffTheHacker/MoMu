Solamine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trialkylamines. These are organic compounds containing a trialkylamine group, characterized by exactly three alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen. Solamine is slightly soluble (in water) and a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, solamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, solamine can be found in fruits and potato. This makes solamine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
