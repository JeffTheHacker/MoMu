it is the 17,21-dipropionate ester of betamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid with metabolic, immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions. it binds to specific intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently binds to DNA to modify gene expression. The synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins is induced while the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators is inhibited. As a result, there is an overall reduction in chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions.
