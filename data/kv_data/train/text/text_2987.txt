Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, debilitating neurological disease that can lead to profound cognitive and physical symptoms, severely affecting quality of life. It is the main cause of neurological disability not caused by trauma in the young adult population of both North America and Europe. Relapsing-remitting forms of MS lead to neurological symptoms that resolve and recur periodically. More than 80% of patients suffering from this disease have relapsing-remitting MS.  it is a new drug from the fumarate class formulated to treat various relapsing forms of MS.  This drug is bioequivalent to [Dimethyl fumarate](initially manufactured in 2013), but is less likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects, owing to its unique chemical structure. it was formulated by Alkermes in collaboration with Biogen, and approved by the FDA on October 30, 2019.
