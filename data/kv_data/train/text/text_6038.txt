Valyl-methionine, also known as it or val-met, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dipeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of exactly two alpha-amino acids joined by a peptide bond. Valyl-methionine is slightly soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Valyl-methionine has been primarily detected in feces.
