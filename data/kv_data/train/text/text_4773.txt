it is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Nonselective beta adrenal receptor blockers may no longer be first line in the treatment of hypertension as newer generations of beta adrenal receptor blockers have higher selectivity and offer better rates of adverse effects.  it was granted FDA approval on 10 December 1979. it is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic activities. it competitively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors located in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the activities of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and producing negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. This agent exhibits antiarrhythmic activity via the impairment of atrioventricular (AV) node conduction and a corresponding reduction in sinus rate. In the kidney, inhibition of the beta-2 receptor within the juxtaglomerular apparatus results in the inhibition of renin production and a subsequent reduction in angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, thus inhibiting angiotensin II-dependent vasoconstriction and aldosterone-dependent water retention.
