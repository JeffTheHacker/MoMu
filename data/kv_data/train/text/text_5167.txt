Iron is an essential heavy metal that is included in many over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements and is used therapeutically in higher doses to treat or prevent iron deficiency anemia. When taken at the usual recommended daily allowance or in replacement doses, iron has little or no adverse effect on the liver. In high doses and in intentional or accidental overdoses, iron causes serious toxicities, one component of which is acute liver damage. it is a form of mineral iron for oral administration, it is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and combines with apoferritin to form ferritin, which is stored in the liver, spleen, red bone marrow, and intestinal mucosa. Important in transport of oxygen by hemoglobin to the tissues, iron is also found in myoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin, and is as a component of many enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, and cytochromes.
