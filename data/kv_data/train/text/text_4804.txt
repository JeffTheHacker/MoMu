2, 5-Diethyltetrahydrofuran, also known as fema 3743, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tetrahydrofurans. These are heterocyclic compounds containing a saturated, aliphatic, five-membered ring where a carbon is replaced by an oxygen. 2, 5-Diethyltetrahydrofuran is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2, 5-diethyltetrahydrofuran is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 5-diethyltetrahydrofuran can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 5-diethyltetrahydrofuran a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
