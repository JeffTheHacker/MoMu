3-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-1, 2-diphenylbut-3-en-2-yl propanoate, also known as itit, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1, 2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. 3-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-1, 2-diphenylbut-3-en-2-yl propanoate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule.
