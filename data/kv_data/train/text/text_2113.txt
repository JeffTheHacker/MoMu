(S)-3-Methylthiohexyl acetate, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carboxylic acid esters. These are carboxylic acid derivatives in which the carbon atom from the carbonyl group is attached to an alkyl or an aryl moiety through an oxygen atom (forming an ester group) (S)-3-Methylthiohexyl acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, (S)-3-methylthiohexyl acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (S)-3-methylthiohexyl acetate can be found in fruits. This makes (S)-3-methylthiohexyl acetate a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
