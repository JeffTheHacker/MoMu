Yamogenintetroside b, also known as it or MPD CPD, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. Yamogenintetroside b is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Yamogenintetroside b has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, yamogenintetroside b is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, yamogenintetroside b can be found in herbs and spices and pulses. This makes yamogenintetroside b a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
