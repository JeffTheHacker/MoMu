it is an organic calcium salt. It contains a nedocromil(2-). it is the calcium salt form of nedocromil, a pyranoquinolone derivative with anti-inflammatory properties. Nedocromil inhibits the activation and release of inflammatory mediators (leukotrienes, histamine and prostaglandins) from a variety of cells involved in hypersensitivity reactions, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes and platelets. As a result, nedocromil sodium inhibits both immediate and late bronchoconstriction, decreases bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inhibits recruitment of other inflammatory cells into the airway epithelium.
