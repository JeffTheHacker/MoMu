7, 9-Dimethyluric acid, also known as 7, 9-dimethylate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthines. These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety. 7, 9-Dimethyluric acid is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). 7, 9-Dimethyluric acid has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 7, 9-dimethyluric acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
