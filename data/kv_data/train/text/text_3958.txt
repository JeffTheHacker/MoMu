it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Kidney Cancer, Gastric Cancer, and Prostate Cancer, among others. it is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. it binds to and inhibits the autophosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and cell proliferation. it also inhibits the phosphorylation of the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit, often expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia cells.
