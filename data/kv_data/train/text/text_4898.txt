Guaiol acetate belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Guaiol acetate is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, guaiol acetate is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Guaiol acetate has a fatty, green, and rose taste.
