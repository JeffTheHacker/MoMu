Desglucocheirotoxin, also known as it or strophalloside, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cardenolide glycosides and derivatives. Cardenolide glycosides and derivatives are compounds containing a carbohydrate glycosidically bound to the cardenolide moiety. Desglucocheirotoxin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Desglucocheirotoxin has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, desglucocheirotoxin is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP).
