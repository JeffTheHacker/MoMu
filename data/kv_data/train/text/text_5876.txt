it is a hydrochloride salt prepared from equimolar amounts of trazodone and hydrogen chloride. It has a role as a serotonin uptake inhibitor, a H1-receptor antagonist, an adrenergic antagonist, a sedative and an antidepressant. It contains a trazodone. it is the hydrochloride salt form of trazodone, a synthetic triazolopyridine derivative with antidepressant and sedative properties. Based on studies from animal models, trazodone selectively inhibits the re-uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes in the brain, thereby increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft and potentiating serotonin activity. Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system. The sedative effect of trazodone is likely via alpha-adrenergic and mild histamine H1 blocking actions.
