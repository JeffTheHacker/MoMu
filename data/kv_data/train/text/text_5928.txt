Pemetrexed is a parenterally administered folate antagonist and antineoplastic agent, used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Pemetrexed therapy has been associated with moderate rates of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been convincingly linked to instances of acute, clinically apparent liver injury. it is the disodium salt of a synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) which catalyses the methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.
