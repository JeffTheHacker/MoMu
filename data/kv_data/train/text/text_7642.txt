3b, 18b-3-Methoxy-11-oxo-12-oleanen-30-Oic acid, also known as methyl 18-beta-glycyrrhetate or 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid methylester, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. 3b, 18b-3-Methoxy-11-oxo-12-oleanen-30-Oic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 3b, 18b-3-methoxy-11-oxo-12-oleanen-30-Oic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3b, 18b-3-methoxy-11-oxo-12-oleanen-30-Oic acid can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 3b, 18b-3-methoxy-11-oxo-12-oleanen-30-Oic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
