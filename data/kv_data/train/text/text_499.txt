it is a modified glutathione analogue and nitrogen mustard prodrug, with potential antineoplastic activity. it is selectively activated by glutathione S-transferase P1-1 into an alkylating metabolite that forms covalent linkages with nucleophilic centers in tumor cell DNA, which may induce a cellular stress response and cytotoxicity, and decrease tumor cell proliferation. Glutathione S-transferase P1-1 is an enzyme that is overexpressed in many human malignancies.
