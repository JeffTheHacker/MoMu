it is an four-carbon ester form of Testosterone. The number of ester carbon atoms correlate with the half-life of the prodrug. Testosterone inhibits gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland and ablates estrogen production in the ovaries, thereby decreasing endogenous estrogen levels. In addition, this agent promotes the maintenance of male sex characteristics and is indicated for testosterone replacement in hypogonadal males. (NCI04)
