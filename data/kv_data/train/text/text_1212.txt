Primaquine is an aminoquinoline that has been used for the prevention and therapy of malaria for more than 50 years. Primaquine is not associated with serum enzyme elevations during therapy and has yet to be linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is the phosphate salt form of primaquine, a synthetic, 8-aminoquinoline derivative with antimalarial properties. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, primaquine bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA. This agent eliminates tissue (exo-erythrocytic) malarial infection, preventing the development of the erythrocytic forms of the parasite which are responsible for relapses in Plasmodium vivax and ovale malaria. Primaquine is active against late hepatic stages (hypnozoites, schizonts).
