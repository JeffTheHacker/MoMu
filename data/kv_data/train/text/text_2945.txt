it is a 2-furoate ester, a steroid ester, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, an organochlorine compound and a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug and an anti-allergic agent. It derives from a mometasone. it is the furoate salt form of mometasone, a synthetic topical glucocorticosteroid receptor agonist with anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. it exerts its effect by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. This results in synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins, while inhibiting the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators.. Specifically, it appears to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, thereby controlling the release of the inflammatory precursor arachidonic acid from phospholipid membrane by phospholipase A2.
