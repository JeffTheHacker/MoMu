it is an amygdalin in which the stereocentre on the cyanohydrin function has R-configuration. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It derives from a (R)-mandelonitrile. Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glucoside isolated from almonds and seeds of other plants of the family Rosaceae. Amygdalin is converted by plant emulsin (a combination of a glucosidase and a nitrilase) or hydrochloric acid into benzaldehyde, D-glucose, and hydrocyanic acid. (NCI04)
