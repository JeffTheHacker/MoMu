it is a piperazine compound having 1,2-benzothiazol-3-yl- and 2-(6-chloro-1,3-dihydro-2-oxindol-5-yl)ethyl substituents attached to the nitrogen atoms. It has a role as a psychotropic drug, a histamine antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a dopaminergic antagonist and an antipsychotic agent. It is a member of piperazines, an organochlorine compound, a member of indolones and a 1,2-benzisothiazole. it is a benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property. it functions as an antagonist at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor. it also inhibits the synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. The mechanism of action by which it exerts its antischizophrenic effect is unknown but is potentially mediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 antagonism. This agent also has antagonistic activity against histamine H1 and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.
