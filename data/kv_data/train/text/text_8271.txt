Palonosetron, also known as 2-qhbiqo or aloxi, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoquinolones and derivatives. These are aromatic polycyclic compounds containing a ketone bearing isoquinoline moiety. Palonosetron is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Palonosetron has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, palonosetron is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
