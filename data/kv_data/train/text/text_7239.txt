it is a member of the class of maleimides that is maleimide which is substituted at position 3 by an indol-3-yl group and at position 4 by a quinazolin-4-yl group, which in turn is substituted at position 2 by a 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl group. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C and has been investigated as an immunosuppresant in renal transplant patients. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor, an immunosuppressive agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a member of indoles, a member of quinazolines and a member of maleimides. it is an orally available pan-protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor with potential immunosuppressive and antineoplastic activities. it inhibits both T- and B-cell activations via PKC theta and beta isozymes, respectively. Both PKCs are important in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB). Inhibition of PKC beta in B-cells results in prevention of NF-kB-mediated signaling and down regulation of NF-kB target genes. This may eventually lead to an induction of G1 cell cycle arrest and tumor cell apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. This agent may act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents. PKC, a family of serine/threonine protein kinases overexpressed in certain types of cancer cells, is involved in cell differentiation, mitogenesis, inflammation, and the activation and survival of lymphocytes.
