it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthopyranones. Naphthopyranones are compounds containing a naphthopyran skeleton where a ring carbon bears a carboxylic acid group. Naphthtopyran is made up of the pyran ring fused to a naphthalene ring system. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
