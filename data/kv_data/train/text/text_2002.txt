it is a ginsenoside found in Panax species that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 20 have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside and beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside respectively, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a beta-D-glucoside, a disaccharide derivative, a ginsenoside and a tetracyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
