Alpha-Cadinol, also known as a-cadinol or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Alpha-Cadinol exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, Alpha-cadinol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Alpha-Cadinol is a herb and wood tasting compound that can be found in a number of food items such as fruits, cloves, ginger, and common oregano. This makes Alpha-cadinol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
