it is an isoquinoline alkaloid that is the biaryl resulting from substitution of the hydrogen at the 5-position of (1R,3R)-1,3-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-8-ol by a 5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-methylnaphthalen-1-yl group. It is a naphthylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the roots and stem barks of Triphyophyllum peltatum and exhibits antimalarial activity. It has a role as an antimalarial, an antiplasmodial drug and a metabolite.
