it is a cephalosporin bearing chloro and (R)-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido groups at positions 3 and 7, respectively, of the cephem skeleton. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and a drug allergen. it is the anhydrous form of it, a beta-lactam, second-generation cephalosporin with antibacterial activity. it binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
