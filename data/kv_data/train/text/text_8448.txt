it is a branched amino tetrasaccharide that consists of the linear trisaccharide alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in which an alpha-L-fucosyl residue is attached at position 3 of the glucoamine. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
