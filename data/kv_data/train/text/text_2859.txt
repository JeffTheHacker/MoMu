it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT03722576 (it Calcium for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis). it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), with potential anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating and anti-viral activities. Upon administration, it specifically targets, binds to and prevents the activation of DHODH. This prevents the fourth enzymatic step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in activated lymphocytes. DHODH inhibition also leads to metabolic stress in activated lymphocytes and inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17A and IL-17F) and interferon-gamma (IFNg), thereby reducing inflammation. In addition, DHODH inhibition may lead to host-based anti-viral activity against many viruses. DHODH, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate, is a key enzyme in pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis. Metabolically highly activated and rapidly proliferating lymphocytes and various virus infected cells require de novo synthesis to meet their needs for pyrimidines.
