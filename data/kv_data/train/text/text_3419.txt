it is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is N,N-diethylprop-2-enamide in which the hydrogen at position 2 is substituted by a cyano group and the hydrogen at the 3E position is substituted by a 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl group. It has a role as an EC 2.1.1.6 (catechol O-methyltransferase) inhibitor, an antiparkinson drug, a central nervous system drug and an antidyskinesia agent. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a nitrile, a member of catechols and a member of 2-nitrophenols. it is a nitrocatechol compound with anti-parkinsonian property. it is a selective and reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure including dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. When administered in conjunction with dopaminergic agents such as L-DOPA, it prevents the metabolism and inactivation of adjunct drugs, thereby increasing the bioavailability of these compounds by facilitating their passage across the blood-brain barrier.
