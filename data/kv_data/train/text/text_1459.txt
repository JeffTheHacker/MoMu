it, also known as 2-bromo-3-formylindole or gbetagamma modulator i, M119, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indoles. Indoles are compounds containing an indole moiety, which consists of pyrrole ring fused to benzene to form 2, 3-benzopyrrole. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2-bromo-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
