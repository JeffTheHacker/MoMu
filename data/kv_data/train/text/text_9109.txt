3'-Ketolactose belongs to the class of organic compounds known as disaccharides. Disaccharides are compounds containing two carbohydrate moieties linked to each to each other through a glycosidic bond, no set of three or more glycosidically linked carbohydrate units. 3'-Ketolactose is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 3'-ketolactose is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
