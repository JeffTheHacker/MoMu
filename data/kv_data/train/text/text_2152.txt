it is a novel, highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor indicated for the management of chorea associated with Huntingtonâs disease. It is a hexahydro-dimethoxybenzoquinolizine derivative and a deuterated [DB04844]. The presence of deuterium in it increases the half-lives of the active metabolite and prolongs their pharmacological activity by attenuating CYP2D6 metabolism of the compound. This allows less frequent dosing and a lower daily dose with improvement in tolerability. Decreased plasma fluctuations of it due to attenuated metabolism may explain a lower incidence of adverse reactions associated with it. it is a racemic mixture containing  RR-it and SS-it.   Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and neuropsychiatric disturbances that interfere with daily functioning and significantly reduce the quality of life. The most prominent physical symptom of HD that may increase the risk of injury is chorea, which is an involuntary, sudden movement that can affect any muscle and flow randomly across body regions. Psychomotor symptoms of HD, such as chorea, are related to hyperactive dopaminergic neurotransmission. it depletes the levels of presynaptic dopamine by blocking VMAT2, which is responsible for the uptake of dopamine into synaptic vesicles in monoaminergic neurons and exocytotic release. As with other agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, it is a drug to alleviate the motor symptoms of HD and is not proposed to halt the progression of the disease. In clinical trials of patients with HD, 12 weeks of treatment of it resulted in overall improvement in mean total maximal chorea scores and motor signs than placebo. It was approved by FDA in April 2017 and is marketed under the trade name it as oral tablets.
