it (anhydrous) is the anhydrous form of the calcium salt of fenprofen. The dihydrate form is used as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with disorders such as arthritis. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor. It contains a fenoprofen(1-). Fenoprofen Calcium is the calcium salt form of fenoprofen, a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, non-steroidal antiinflammatory and antirheumatic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits both isozymes of cyclooxygenase; resulting in prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In addition, fenoprofen activate both peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, by which it may down-regulate leukotriene B4 production.
