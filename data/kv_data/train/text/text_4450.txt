Prunin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid-7-o-glycosides. These are phenolic compounds containing a flavonoid moiety which is O-glycosidically linked to carbohydrate moiety at the C7-position. Prunin is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Prunin is a bitter tasting compound that can be found in almond, garden tomato (var. ), peach, and pine nut. This makes prunin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
