it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02895360 (Phase 1/2a Study of it as 48-hour Infusions in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Recurrent Glioblastoma). it is an orally available, highly water-soluble lysine prodrug of the synthetic small molecule BAL27862 with potential antitumor activity. Upon administration of it and conversion into the active form BAL27862, this agent binds to tubulin at a site distinct from the vinca-alkaloid-binding site, and prevents tubulin polymerization and destabilizes microtubules, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest, blockage of cell division and an induction of cell death in cancer cells.
