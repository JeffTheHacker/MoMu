it is the dihydrochloride salt form of atiprimod, an orally bioavailable small molecule belonging to the azaspirane class of cationic amphiphilic agents with anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, and anti-angiogenic activities. Atiprimod inhibits the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and AKT, blocking the signaling pathways of interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and downregulating the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1. This results in the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.
