2, 6-Pipecoloxylidide, also known as desbutylbupivacaine or pipecolylxylidine-2', 6', belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acid amides. These are amide derivatives of alpha amino acids. 2, 6-Pipecoloxylidide is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. 2, 6-Pipecoloxylidide has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, 2, 6-pipecoloxylidide is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
