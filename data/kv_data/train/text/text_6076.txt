Doxazosin is a nonselective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (alpha-blocker) used in the therapy of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Doxazosin is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. it is the mesylate salt form of doxazosin, a quinazoline compound with smooth muscle relaxing activity. it selectively antagonizes alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate, thereby relaxing the smooth muscle and decreasing the obstruction and urethral resistance seen with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). This may improve BPH symptoms. This agent also blocks alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in peripheral vascular smooth muscle, which leads to vasodilatation and a subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.
