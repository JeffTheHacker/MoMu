KT 5720 is an organic heterooctacyclic compound that is 1H,1'H-2,2'-biindole in which the nitrogens have undergone formal oxidative coupling to positions 2 and 5 of hexyl (3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methyltetrahydrofuran-3-carboxylate (the 2R,3S,5S product), and in which the 3 and 3' positions of the biindole moiety have also undergone formal oxidative coupling to positions 3 and 4 of 1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.11 (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) inhibitor. It is an organic heterooctacyclic compound, a gamma-lactam, a tertiary alcohol, a carboxylic ester, a hemiaminal, a semisynthetic derivative and an indolocarbazole. It derives from a K-252a.
