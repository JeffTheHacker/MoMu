it is a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside compound having 5-bromouracil as the nucleobase. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antimetabolite. it is a halogenated thymidine analogue with potential antineoplastic and radiosensitizing activities. it competes with thymidine for incorporation into DNA, resulting in DNA mutation and the inhibition of cell proliferation. As a radiosensitizer, this agent is associated with the inhibition of repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks.
