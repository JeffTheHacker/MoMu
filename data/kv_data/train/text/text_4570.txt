it is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat potentially life-threatening fungal infections. It has a role as an antiprotozoal drug and a bacterial metabolite. It is a macrolide antibiotic, a polyene antibiotic and an antibiotic antifungal drug. it is a polyene antifungal antibiotic produced by Streptomyces nodosus, with antifungal activity. it binds to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, thereby causing depolarization of the membrane and altering cell membrane permeability. This leads to leakage of important intracellular components, cell rupture, and eventually cell death. This agent may also induce oxidative damage in fungal cells and has been reported to stimulate host immune cells.
