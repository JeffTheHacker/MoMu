Butylscopolamine bromide is an organic bromide salt of butylscopolamine. It is an antispasmodic drug which can relieve painful stomach cramps (including those linked with irritable bowel syndrome), bladder and menstrual cramps. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is an organic bromide salt and a quaternary ammonium salt. It contains a butylscopolamine. Butylscopolamine Bromide is an orally available bromide salt form of butylscopolamine, a quaternary ammonium derivative of the alkaloid scopolamine, with anticholinergic property. Upon oral administration, it binds to and blocks muscarinic receptors located on postganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings and on smooth muscle cells. This blocks the activity of acetylcholine (Ach) and causes its antispasmodic effect in the gastrointestinal (GI), urinary, uterine, and biliary tracts. This agent may also facilitate radiologic visualization of the GI tract.
