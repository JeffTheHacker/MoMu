it, also known as cyprosterone acetate or androcur, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as menthane monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids with a structure based on the o-, m-, or p-menthane backbone. P-menthane consists of the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group and a (2-methyl)-propyl group at the 1 and 4 ring position, respectively. The o- and m- menthanes are much rarer, and presumably arise by alkyl migration of p-menthanes it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (R)-carvotanacetone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (R)-carvotanacetone can be found in dill and lovage. This makes (R)-carvotanacetone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
