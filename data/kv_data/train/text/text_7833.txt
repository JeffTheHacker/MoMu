it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as flavonoid-7-o-glycosides. These are phenolic compounds containing a flavonoid moiety which is O-glycosidically linked to carbohydrate moiety at the C7-position. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices and rosemary. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
