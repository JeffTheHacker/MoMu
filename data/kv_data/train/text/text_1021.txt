it appears as odorless white crystalline powder or lumps. Slightly alkaline (bitter) taste. pH (of freshly prepared 0.1 molar aqueous solution): 8.3 at 77Â°F. pH (of saturated solution): 8-9. Non-toxic. it is an organic sodium salt and a one-carbon compound. It has a role as an antacid and a food anticaking agent. It contains a hydrogencarbonate. it is the monosodium salt of carbonic acid with alkalinizing and electrolyte replacement properties. Upon dissociation, it forms sodium and bicarbonate ions. Ion formation increases plasma bicarbonate and buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, resulting in raised blood pH.
