(R)-it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenones are compounds containing a cylohexenone moiety, which is a six-membered aliphatic ring that carries a ketone and has one endocyclic double bond (R)-it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (R)-ite is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (R)-ite can be found in herbs and spices. This makes (R)-ite a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
