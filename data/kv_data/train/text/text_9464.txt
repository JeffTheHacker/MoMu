it is an amino acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-carbamoyl-2,6-dimethyl-L-phenylalanine with the secondary amino group of 2-methoxy-5-({[(1S)-1-(4-phenylimidazol-2-yl)ethyl]amino}methyl)benzoic acid. It has mixed opioid receptor activity and is used for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a delta-opioid receptor antagonist, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist and a gastrointestinal drug.
