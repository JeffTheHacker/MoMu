N-Palmitoylsphingosine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ceramides. These are lipid molecules containing a sphingosine in which the amine group is linked to a fatty acid. N-Palmitoylsphingosine exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. N-Palmitoylsphingosine has been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, N-palmitoylsphingosine is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP), endosome and intracellular membrane.
