L-it, also known as alpha-amino-beta-(pyrazolyl-N)propionic acid or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). L-it exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, L-2-amino-3-(1-pyrazolyl)propanoic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, L-2-amino-3-(1-pyrazolyl)propanoic acid can be found in fruits. This makes L-2-amino-3-(1-pyrazolyl)propanoic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
