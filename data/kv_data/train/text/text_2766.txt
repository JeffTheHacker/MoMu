it is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluorobenzoic acid with methylamine. Used for the treatment of of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an androgen antagonist. It is a member of benzamides, an imidazolidinone, a thiocarbonyl compound, a nitrile, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a member of monofluorobenzenes. it is an orally bioavailable, organic, non-steroidal small molecule targeting the androgen receptor (AR) with potential antineoplastic activity. Through a mechanism that is reported to be different from other approved AR antagonists, it inhibits the activity of prostate cancer cell ARs, which may result in a reduction in prostate cancer cell proliferation and, correspondingly, a reduction in the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. AR over-expression in prostate cancer represents a key mechanism associated with prostate cancer hormone resistance.
