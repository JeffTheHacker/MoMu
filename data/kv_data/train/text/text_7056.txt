it is 2-Amino-9H-purine in which the hydrogen at position 9 is substituted by a 4-acetoxy-3-(acetoxymethyl)but-1-yl group. A prodrug of the antiviral penciclovir, it is used for the treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles), for the treatment or suppression of recurrent genital herpes in immunocompetent patients and for the treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in HIV infected patients. It has a role as a prodrug and an antiviral drug. It is a member of 2-aminopurines and an acetate ester. it is a diacetyl 6-deoxy prodrug analog of the antiviral agent penciclovir. Orally administered, it in vivo is converted to penciclovir triphosphate, which is active against the Herpes viruses, including herpes simplex 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster. This agent inhibits the replication of viral DNA by interfering competitively with DNA polymerase. (NCI04)
