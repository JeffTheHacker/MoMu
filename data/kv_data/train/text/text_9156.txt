it is a sulfonamide resulting from the formal condensation of the sulfonic acid group of 5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid with the aniline nitrogen of 3-(2-acetamido-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)aniline. It has been reported that by triggering an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, it can reduce the viability of melanoma cells without being toxic to normal cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a sulfonamide, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a member of acetamides, a tertiary amino compound, an aminonaphthalene and a biaryl.
