it is a leukotriene composed of (6Z,8E,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid having (5S)- and (12R)-hydroxy substituents. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a leukotriene, a long-chain fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from an icosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). it is a leukotriene synthesized from leukotriene A4 by leukotriene A-4 hydrolase in monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, reticulocytes, platelets and fibroblasts. it modulates inflammation by promoting neutrophil activation and inducing adhesion, activation, and transendothelial migration of leukocytes.
