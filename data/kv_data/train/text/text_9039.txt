(2E)-Butenoyl-CoA belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-enoyl coas. These are organic compounds containing a coenzyme A substructure linked to a 2-enoyl chain (2E)-Butenoyl-CoA is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa) (2E)-Butenoyl-CoA has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, (2E)-butenoyl-CoA is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
