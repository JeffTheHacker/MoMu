it has been used in trials studying the treatment of Myelodysplasia, Solid Neoplasm, Advanced Cancers, Advanced Solid Tumors, and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, among others. it is an orally bioavailable, adenosine triphospate mimetic, and inhibitor of Aurora kinases, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRs), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it selectively binds to and inhibits Aurora kinases A, B and C, which may disrupt both the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and chromosome segregation, and inhibit both cellular division and proliferation in Aurora kinase-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, it selectively binds to and inhibits VEGFRs and PDGFRs, which may result in the inhibition of both angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation in VEGFR/PDGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. This agent also inhibits the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Aurora kinases A, B and C, are serine/threonine kinases that play essential roles in mitotic checkpoint control and are overexpressed by a wide variety of tumor cell types. Both VEGFRs and PDGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinase families whose members may be upregulated in various tumor cell types.
