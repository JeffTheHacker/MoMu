it is a C-glycosyl comprising beta-D-glucose in which the anomeric hydroxy group is replaced by a 4-chloro-3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl group. Used (in the formo f its propanediol monohydrate) to improve glycemic control, along with diet and exercise, in adults with type 2 diabetes. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent and a sodium-glucose transport protein subtype 2 inhibitor. It is a C-glycosyl compound, an organochlorine compound and an aromatic ether. it is a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter subtype 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with antihyperglycemic activity. it selectively and potently inhibits SGLT2 compared to SGLT1, which is the cotransporter of glucose in the gut.
