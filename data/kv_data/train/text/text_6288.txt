it is a lipophilic, anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic. it intercalates into DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair as well as inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis. This agent appears to not be a substrate for the p-glycoprotein associated multidrug-resistance (MDR) transporter; therefore, overcoming the resistance pattern seen with other anthracycline compounds.
