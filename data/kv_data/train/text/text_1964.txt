it is a clear colorless viscous liquid with a pungent offensive odor of mercaptans. Used as a medicine and an antidote to the chemical warfare agent LEWISITE. it is a dithiol that is propane-1,2-dithiol in which one of the methyl hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxy group. a chelating agent originally developed during World War II as an experimental antidote against the arsenic-based poison gas Lewisite, it has been used clinically since 1949 for the treatment of poisoning by arsenic, mercury and gold. It can also be used for treatment of poisoning by antimony, bismuth and possibly thallium, and (with sodium calcium edetate) in cases of acute leaad poisoning. Administration is by (painful) intramuscular injection of a suspension of it in peanut oil, typically every 4 hours for 2-10 days depending on the toxicity. In the past, it was also used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a severely debilitating genetic disorder in which the body tends to retain copper, with resultant liver and brain injury. It has a role as a chelator. It is a dithiol and a primary alcohol. it is a metal chelating agent that is used as an antidote in arsenic, gold, lead, mercury and other heavy metal poisoning. Metals form ligands in the body with the sulfhydryl groups of the pyruvate-oxidase enzyme system. This leads to an inhibition of the normal functioning of these enzymes that are dependent on free sulfhydryl groups for their activity. it reverses the enzyme inhibition by chelating the metal and regenerates free sulfhydryl groups, thereby preventing and reversing the metals toxic effects.
