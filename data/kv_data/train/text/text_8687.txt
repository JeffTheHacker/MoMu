it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as delta valerolactones. These are cyclic organic compounds containing an oxan-2- one moiety. it is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, xi-it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xi-it can be found in fruits. This makes xi-it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
