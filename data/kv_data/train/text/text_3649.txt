it is one of several glycerophosphate salts. It is used clinically to treat or prevent low phosphate levels. Glycerophosphate is hydrolyzed to inorganic phosphate and glycerol in the body. The extent of this reaction is dependent on the activity of serum alkaline phosphatases. Sodium Glycerophosphate is the sodium salt form of an organic phosphate compound that provides phosphate for nutritional purposes. In addition, sodium glycerophosphate can be used as a phosphate diluting agent upon internal contamination with the beta-emiting radioisotope phosphate P 32 (P-32) that competes with P-32 for absorption. As sodium glycerophosphate is administered in high amounts, the absorption of P-32 is prevented or minimalized.
