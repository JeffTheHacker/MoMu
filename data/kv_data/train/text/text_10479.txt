it is a member of the class of oxindoles resulting from formal oxidative coupling between the 3-position of 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one and the 3-position of 1,3-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one, which is substituted at the 5 position by a 1H-indol-3-yl group, where the newly-formed double bond has E configuration. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agent. It is an olefinic compound, a member of oxindoles and a member of pyrroles. It derives from a proviolacein.
