it, also known as 3-O-(4-O-methylgalloyl)epigallocatechin or 4''-O-methylepigallocatechin 3-O-gallate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as catechin gallates. These are organic compounds containing a gallate moiety glycosidically linked to a catechin it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule it has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-(4-methyl-gallate) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-(4-methyl-gallate) can be found in tea. This makes (-)-epigallocatechin 3-(4-methyl-gallate) a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
