it is a steroid ester in which a 5alpha-androstane skeleton is C-3alpha- and C-17beta-disubstituted with acetoxy groups and 2beta- and 16beta-disubstituted with 1-methylpiperidinium-1-yl groups. It is a non-depolarizing curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It has a role as a muscle relaxant, a cholinergic antagonist and a nicotinic antagonist. It is a steroid ester and an acetate ester. it is a synthetic, long-acting bis-quaternary steroid and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, with muscle relaxant activity. it competitively binds to and blocks the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing acetylcholine (ACh) binding and resulting in skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis.
