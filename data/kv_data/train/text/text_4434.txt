Ipratropium is a synthetic anticholinergic agent that is used as an inhalant for treatment of acute bronchospasm due to chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Ipratropium has not been implicated in causing liver enzyme elevations or clinically apparent acute liver injury. Ipratropium is a synthetic derivative of the alkaloid atropine with anticholinergic properties. Ipratropium antagonizes the actions of acetylcholine at parasympathetic postganglionic effector cell junctions. When inhaled, ipratropium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle thereby blocking the bronchoconstrictor actions of the acetylcholine (Ach) mediated vagal impulses. Inhibition of the vagal tone leads to dilation of the large central airways resulting in bronchodilation.
