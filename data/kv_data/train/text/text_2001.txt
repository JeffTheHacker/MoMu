it is a carboxamide that is 1,8-diaminooctane in which a hydrogen attached to each of the amino groups has been replaced by a dichloroacetyl group. Inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a2 (ALDH1a2). Inhibits the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from retinol in neonatal and adult murine testis. It down-regulates sex related genes in zebrafish. It has a role as an EC 1.2.1.3 [aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(+))] inhibitor. It is an organochlorine compound and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a dichloroacetic acid and a 1,8-diaminooctane.
