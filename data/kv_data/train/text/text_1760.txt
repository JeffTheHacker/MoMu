Deferoxamine is a parenterally administered iron chelating agent used to treat transfusion related chronic iron overload. Deferoxamine rarely causes serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has not been convincingly linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. it is the mesylate salt of an iron-chelating agent that binds free iron in a stable complex, preventing it from engaging in chemical reactions. Deferoxamine chelates iron from intra-lysosomal ferritin and ferrioxamine, a water-soluble complex excreted by the kidneys and in the feces via the bile. This agent does not readily chelate iron bound to transferrin, hemoglobin, myoglobin or cytochrome.
