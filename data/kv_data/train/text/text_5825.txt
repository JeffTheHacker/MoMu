it is an L-alanine derivative that is isopropyl L-alaninate in which one of the amino hydrogens is replaced by an (S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl group. A prodrug for tenofovir, it is used (as the fumarate salt) in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It has a role as an antiviral drug, a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a L-alanine derivative, a phosphoramidate ester, an ether, a member of 6-aminopurines and an isopropyl ester. It derives from an adenine. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a lipophilic phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir, a synthetic antiviral acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine 5-monophosphate and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and potentially against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Upon oral administration, it is taken up by hepatocytes through passive diffusion and through the hepatic uptake transporters organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1) and 1B3 (OATP1B3). Inside the hepatocytes, it is hydrolyzed and converted to tenofovir by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Intracellular tenofovir is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its pharmacologically active form, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate is incorporated into viral DNA instead of the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate, and inhibits HBV reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain-termination and inhibition of HBV replication. In addition, tenofovir diphosphate is incorporated into HIV DNA instead of the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and resulting in DNA chain termination and impairment of HIV replication.
