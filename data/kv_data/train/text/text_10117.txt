it, also known as it or 4-ethyl-3-methyl-2-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclic ketones. These are organic compounds containing a ketone that is conjugated to a cyclic moiety. it is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-ethyl-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 4-ethyl-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one can be found in coffee and coffee products. This makes 4-ethyl-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
