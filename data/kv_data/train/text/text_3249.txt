it is a benzothiadiazine that is the S,S-dioxide of 2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine which is substituted at position 3 by a methyl group and at position 7 by chlorine. A peripheral vasodilator, it increases the concentration of glucose in the plasma and inhibits the secretion of insulin by the beta- cells of the pancreas. It is used orally in the management of intractable hypoglycaemia and intravenously in the management of hypertensive emergencies. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a sodium channel blocker, a vasodilator agent, a K-ATP channel agonist, a beta-adrenergic agonist, a cardiotonic drug, a bronchodilator agent, a sympathomimetic agent and a diuretic. It is a benzothiadiazine, a sulfone and an organochlorine compound. it is a benzothiadiazine derivate with antihypertensive and hyperglycemic activities. it increases membrane permeability to potassium ions in vascular smooth muscle, thereby stabilizing the membrane action potential and preventing vascular smooth muscle contraction; this results in peripheral vasodilatation and decreases in peripheral vascular resistance. This agent also inhibits insulin release by interacting with ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic islet beta-cells.
