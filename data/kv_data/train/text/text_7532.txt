2, 4, 6-Trimethylbenzaldehyde, also known as 2-mesitylenecarboxaldehyde or b-isodural, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzoyl derivatives. These are organic compounds containing an acyl moiety of benzoic acid with the formula (C6H5CO-). 2, 4, 6-Trimethylbenzaldehyde exists as a liquid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, 2, 4, 6-trimethylbenzaldehyde is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, 2, 4, 6-trimethylbenzaldehyde can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 2, 4, 6-trimethylbenzaldehyde a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
