it is a member of the class of 1,4-benzoquinones that is 1,4-benzoquinone in which three of the ring hydrogens are replaced by aziridin-1-yl groups. It has a role as an alkylating agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of aziridines and a member of 1,4-benzoquinones. it is an aziridinylbenzoquinone-based alkylating agent with potential antineoplastic activity. The alkylating group in it becomes activated upon reduction of quinone to the hydroquinone form. This eventually results in the alkylation and crosslinking of DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication followed by an induction of apoptosis. In addition, reactive oxygen species may form during redox cycling which may contribute to this agent's cytotoxic activity.
