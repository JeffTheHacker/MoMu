4, 4-Dimethoxy-2-butanone, also known as 3-oxobutanal dimethyl acetal or fema 3381, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ketones. These are organic compounds in which a carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms R2C=O (neither R may be a hydrogen atom). Ketones that have one or more alpha-hydrogen atoms undergo keto-enol tautomerization, the tautomer being an enol. 4, 4-Dimethoxy-2-butanone is soluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4, 4-dimethoxy-2-butanone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. 4, 4-Dimethoxy-2-butanone has an alcoholic, bitter, and ethereal taste.
