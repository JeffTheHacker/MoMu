3-(5-fluorouracil-1-yl)-L-alanine is an alanine derivative that is L-alanine bearing a 5-fluorouracil-1-yl substituent at position 3. A more potent and selective AMPA receptor agonist (at hGluR1 and hGluR2) than AMPA itself (Ki = 14.7, 25.1, and 1820 nM for hGluR1, hGluR2 and hGluR5 respectively). It has a role as an AMPA receptor agonist. It is an organofluorine compound, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a L-alanine derivative. It derives from a uracil.
