it is a highly selective bioreductive drug that is activated in, and is preferentially toxic to, hypoxic cells in tumours. It has been shown to work synergistically with fractionated radiation to significantly delay growth of tumours compared to administration of either it or radiation alone. it was also efficacious in tumour models when administered in combination with either cisplatin or chemoradiation. it is a bioreductive, alkylaminoanthraquinone prodrug with antineoplastic activity. Under hypoxic conditions, often seen in solid tumors, it (it) is converted and activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are upregulated in certain tumors, to the cytotoxic DNA-binding agent AQ4. it intercalates into and crosslinks DNA, and inhibits topoisomerase II. This results in an inhibition of DNA replication and repair in tumor cells. Combined with conventional therapeutic agents, both oxygenic and hypoxic regions of tumors can be targeted.
