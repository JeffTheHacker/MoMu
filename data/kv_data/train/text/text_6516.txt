it is the hydrochloride form of exaprolol, a lipophilic derivative of the adrenergic blocking agent propranolol with sympatholytic activity. Exaprolol competitively binds to and blocks beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, thereby causing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects leading to a reduction in cardiac output.
