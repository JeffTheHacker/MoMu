The serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonists are potent prokinetic agents that act on serotonin receptors in the intestine and promote intestinal peristalsis, increase gastric emptying and decrease esophageal reflux. Two 5-HT4 receptor agonists have been developed and were approved for use in the United States, but both were found to have significant serious adverse effects and have been withdrawn (it) or placed under restricted use (tegaserod). Both it and tegaserod have been associated with a low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but neither has been implicated convincing in cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. Cisapride is a substituted piperidinyl benzamide prokinetic agent. Cisapride facilitates release of acetylcholine from the myenteric plexus, resulting in increased gastrointestinal motility. In addition, it has been found to act as a serotonin agonist, stimulating type 4 receptors, and a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. (NCI)
