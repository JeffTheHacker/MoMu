All-trans-it is an all-trans-retinyl ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of palmitic (hexadecanoic acid) with the hydroxy group of all-trans-retinol. It is a it and an all-trans-retinyl ester. It derives from an all-trans-retinol. Retinyl Palmitate is a naturally-occurring phenyl analogue of retinol (vitamin A) with potential antineoplastic and chemopreventive activities. As the most common form of vitamin A taken for dietary supplementation, it binds to and activates retinoid receptors, thereby inducing cell differentiation and decreasing cell proliferation. This agent also inhibits carcinogen-induced neoplastic transformation, induces apoptosis in some cancer cell types, and exhibits immunomodulatory properties. (NCI04)
