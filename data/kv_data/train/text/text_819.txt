it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as vinylogous acids. These are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group, which is indirectly attached to a carbonyl via an intervening vinyl (>C=C<) moiety. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in alcoholic beverages. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
