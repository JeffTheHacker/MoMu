it is a monocarboxylic acid that is 1,3-thiazolidine which is substituted on the nitrogen by a carboxymethyl group, at positions 2 and 4 by thioxo and oxo groups, respectively, and at position 5 by a 2-methyl-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-ylidene group. It is an inhibitor of aldose reductase (which catalyses the conversion of glucose to sorbitol) and is used for the treatment of some diabetic complications, including neuropathy. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a member of thiazolidines and a monocarboxylic acid. it is an orally available, a non-competitive, reversible inhibitor of aldose reductase (AR), with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon oral administration, it non-competitively binds to AR, a polyol pathway enzyme that catalyzes reactive oxygen species (ROS)-initiated lipid peroxidation-generated lipid aldehydes and their glutathione conjugates, which have been implicated in the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which control the transcription of many inflammatory cytokines. Increased inflammatory cytokines and growth factors promote cell proliferation, a primary feature in the tumorigenesis process. AR is overexpressed in several oxidative stress- and inflammation-related conditions, including cancer.
