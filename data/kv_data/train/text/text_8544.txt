it is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone with amino acid sequence CYIQNCPLG that also acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain; the principal uterine-contracting and milk-ejecting hormone of the posterior pituitary. Together with the neuropeptide vasopressin, it is believed to influence social cognition and behaviour. It has a role as an oxytocic and a vasodilator agent. It is a peptide hormone and a heterodetic cyclic peptide. Recombinant it is a synthetic cyclic peptide form of the naturally occurring posterior pituitary hormone it. it binds to it receptors in the uterine myometrium, which triggers the G-protein coupled receptor signal transduction cascade that causes increased intracellular calcium concentrations. Increased calcium concentration levels activate myosin light chain kinase which, in turn, induces the formation of the contractile protein actomyosin. This stimulates uterine smooth muscle contractions. This agent also stimulates smooth muscles in the mammary glands, thereby causing lactation.
