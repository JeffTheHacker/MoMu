it is a monomethoxybenzene compound having a 3-methoxypropoxy group at the 2-position and a multi-substituted branched alkyl substituent at the 4-position. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent. It is a monomethoxybenzene and a monocarboxylic acid amide. it is an orally active nonpeptide renin inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. it selectively binds to the S3 sub-pocket of renin, an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that is responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (AT I). By inhibiting the activity of renin, the conversion to AT I is prevented, which in turn prevents the conversion of AT I to AT II. This prevents arterial vasoconstriction by AT II and inhibits the production of aldosterone by AT II. As aldosterone causes re-uptake of sodium and water and eventually an increase in extracellular volume, it is able to prevent the effects that contribute to an increase in blood pressure.
