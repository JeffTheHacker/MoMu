it is 1-Methyl-1,4-diazepane in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 4 is substituted by a 1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl group. A relatively selective histamine H1 antagonist, it is used as the difumatate salt for allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and pruritic skin disorders, and in eyedrops for the symptomatic relief of allergic conjuntivitis. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an anti-allergic agent and an antipruritic drug. it is a second generation, selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist with anti-allergic activity. it reversibly and competitively blocks histamine by binding to H1 receptors, thus blocking its downstream activity. As a result this agent interferes with mediator release from mast cells either by inhibiting calcium ion influx across mast cell/basophil plasma membrane or by inhibiting intracellular calcium ion release within the cells. In addition, it may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction mediated through leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Upon ocular administration, it causes a dose-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva. it does not affect adrenergic, dopamine, or serotonin receptors.
