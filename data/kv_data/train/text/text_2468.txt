Xanthorrhizol belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sesquiterpenoids. These are terpenes with three consecutive isoprene units. Xanthorrhizol is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, xanthorrhizol is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, xanthorrhizol can be found in beverages, ginger, herbs and spices, and root vegetables. This makes xanthorrhizol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
