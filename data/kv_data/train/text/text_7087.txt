it is an analog of calcitriol and a vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) agonist, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it targets and binds to VDR. This activates VDR and VDR-mediated signal transduction pathways. This modulates the VDR-mediated expression of certain genes, including the expression of anti-cancer genes, enhances cellular differentiation, induces tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell growth. VDR plays a central role in calcium homeostasis and in the growth of certain cancer cells.
