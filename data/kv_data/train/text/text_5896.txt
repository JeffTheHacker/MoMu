it is a hydroxypiperidine that is deoxynojirimycin in which the amino hydrogen is replaced by a butyl group. It has a role as an EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase) inhibitor and an anti-HIV agent. It is a member of piperidines and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a duvoglustat. it is a synthetic, N-alkylated imino analogue of D-glucose. it competitively and reversibly binds to and inhibits the activity of UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the initial step in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSL). This leads to a decrease in the production of glycosphingolipid, which has important roles in various cellular processes. it can be used in substrate reduction therapy in diseases in which the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, that is responsible for the breakdown of GSL, is deficient.
