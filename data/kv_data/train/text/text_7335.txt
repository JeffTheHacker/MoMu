it is a orally administered, triazole antifungal agent used in the treatment of systemic and superficial fungal infections. it therapy is associated with transient, mild-to-moderate serum elevations and can lead to clinically apparent acute drug induced liver injury. it is a synthetic triazole agent with antimycotic properties. Formulated for both topical and systemic use, it preferentially inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in a decrease in fungal ergosterol synthesis. Because of its low toxicity profile, this agent can be used for long-term maintenance treatment of chronic fungal infections. (NCI04)
