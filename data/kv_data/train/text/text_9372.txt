it is an organofluorine compound comprising salicylic acid having a 2,4-difluorophenyl group at the 5-position. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a non-narcotic analgesic. It is an organofluorine compound and a monohydroxybenzoic acid. It derives from a salicylic acid and a 1,3-difluorobenzene. it is a difluorophenyl derivate of salicylic acid and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. it competitively inhibits both cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and -2, with higher affinity for COX-1, and subsequently blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. This leads to an inhibition of the formation of prostaglandins that are involved in pain, inflammation and fever. it differs from other salicylates, in that it is not metabolized to salicylic acid, hence it has a longer half-life.
