it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 8-prenylated flavanones. These are flavanones that features a C5-isoprenoid substituent at the 8-position. Thus, it is considered to be a flavonoid lipid molecule. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, it can be found in herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
