it is an ether compound having fluoromethyl and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl as the two alkyl groups. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a central nervous system depressant. It is an organofluorine compound and an ether. It derives from a 2-methoxypropane. it is a fluorinated isopropyl ether with general anesthetic property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it may act by interfering with the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters at post-synaptic terminals, and/or alter ionic conductance following receptor activation by a neurotransmitter. it may also interact directly with lipid matrix of neuronal membranes, thereby affecting gating properties of ion channels. In addition, this agent may activate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors hyperpolarizing cell membranes. This results in a general anesthetic effect, a decrease in myocardial contractility and mean arterial pressure as well as an increased respiratory rate.
