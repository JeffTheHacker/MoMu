1-Isopropyl-2, 3-dimethylcyclopentane, also known as oseltamivir or iridane, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as monocyclic monoterpenoids. These are monoterpenoids containing 1 ring in the isoprene chain. 1-Isopropyl-2, 3-dimethylcyclopentane is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 1-isopropyl-2, 3-dimethylcyclopentane is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 1-isopropyl-2, 3-dimethylcyclopentane can be found in herbs and spices. This makes 1-isopropyl-2, 3-dimethylcyclopentane a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
