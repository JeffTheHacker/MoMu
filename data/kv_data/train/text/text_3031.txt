Purine-6-thiol is a thiol that is the tautomer of it. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antimetabolite. It is a tautomer of a it. It derives from a hydride of a 7H-purine. it Anhydrous is the anhydrous form of it, a thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities. Produced through the metabolism of it by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), it metabolites 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) inhibit nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine synthesis, thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibiting DNA synthesis. This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, it is converted to 6-methylit ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis.
