Aspirin-triggered protectin D1 is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid that is (4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which the two hydroxy substituents are located at positions 10 and 17 (the 10R,17R-stereoisomer). It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite, an anti-inflammatory agent, a neuroprotective agent and a specialised pro-resolving mediator. It is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid and a secondary allylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of an aspirin-triggered protectin D1(1-).
