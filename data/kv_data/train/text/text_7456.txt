it is a tripeptide consisting of an Ile-Ile-Thr-NH2 sequence N-substituted on the threonamide amidic nitrogen with a (2S)-4-methyl-1-[(2R)-2-methyloxiran-2-yl]-1-oxopentan-2-yl group and with acetyl and methyl groups on the nitrogen of the isoleucine residue distal to the threonamide; a naturally occurring selective proteasome inhibitor with anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as a proteasome inhibitor. It is a member of morpholines and a tripeptide.
