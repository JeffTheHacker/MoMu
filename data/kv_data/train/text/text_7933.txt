it is meropenem in which the one of the two methyl groups attached to the amide nitrogen is replaced by hydrogen while the other is replaced by a 3-carboxyphenyl group. The sodium salt is used for the treatment of moderate to severe susceptible infections including intra-abdominal and acute gynaecological infections, pneumonia, and infections of the skin and of the urinary tract. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It is a carbapenemcarboxylic acid and a pyrrolidinecarboxamide. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). it is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem and broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic with bactericidal property. it binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) located on the bacterial cell wall, in particular PBPs 2 and 3, thereby inhibiting the final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Inhibition results in a weakening and subsequent lysis of the cell wall leading to cell death of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. This agent is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
