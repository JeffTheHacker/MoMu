Betulin, also known as betulenol or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. Betulin exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, betulin is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, betulin can be found in a number of food items such as broad bean, black elderberry, european chestnut, and common walnut. This makes betulin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
