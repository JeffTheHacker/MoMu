Trospium belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. Diphenylmethanes are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups. Trospium is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Trospium has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, trospium is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
