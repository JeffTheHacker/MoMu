it is an alkyl caffeate ester in which 2-phenylethyl is the alkyl component. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulator, a metabolite, an antioxidant, a neuroprotective agent, an antiviral agent and an antibacterial agent. it is the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid and a bioactive component of honeybee hive propolis, with antineoplastic, cytoprotective and immunomodulating activities. Upon administration, it (it) inhibits the activation of nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B and may suppress p70S6K and Akt-driven signaling pathways. In addition, it inhibits PDGF-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and subsequent induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).
