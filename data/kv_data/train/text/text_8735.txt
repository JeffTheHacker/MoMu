it, also known as panaxoside a or sanchinoside C1, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as triterpenoids. These are terpene molecules containing six isoprene units. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, ginsenoside A2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, ginsenoside A2 can be found in tea. This makes ginsenoside A2 a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
