it appears as a liquid. Presents a threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limits its spread to the environment. Easily penetrates the soil and contaminates groundwater or nearby waterways. it is an ortho- and peri-fused polycyclic arene consisting of five fused benzene rings. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent and a mouse metabolite. 3,4-Benzpyrene is a crystalline, aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five fused benzene rings and formed during the incomplete combustion of organic matter. 3,4-Benzpyrene is primarily found in gasoline and diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke, coal tar and coal tar pitch, charcoal-broiled foods and certain other foods, amino acids, fatty acids and carbohydrate pyrolysis products, soot smoke, creosote oil, petroleum asphalt and shale oils. This substance is used only for research purposes. 3,4-Benzpyrene is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
