it is a symmetrical oxalamide-based bis-quaternary ammonium ion having ethyl and 2-chlorobenzyl groups attached to the nitrogens. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. it is a bisquaternary ammonium alcohol with parasympathomimetic activity. The positive charge of it allows it to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor by binding to the anionic site at the reactive center of acetylcholinesterase, preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine and producing an indirect cholinomimetic effect at both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. it also has direct agonist activity at nicotinic receptors, potentiating the cholinomimetic effect at the neuromuscular junction.
