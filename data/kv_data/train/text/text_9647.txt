it is an ethanolamine compound having a (4-carbamoylmethylphenoxy)methyl group at the 1-position and an N-isopropyl substituent. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an antihypertensive agent, a sympatholytic agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of ethanolamines, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a propanolamine. it is a synthetic isopropylamino-propanol derivative used as an antihypertensive, hypotensive and antiarrhythmic it acts as a peripheral, cardioselective beta blocker specific for beta-1 adrenergic receptors, without intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. It reduces exercise heart rates and delays atrioventricular conduction, with overall oxygen requirements decreasing. (NCI04)
