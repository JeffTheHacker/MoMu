it is a citrate salt which comprises equimolar amounts of orphenadrine and citric acid. It has a role as a NMDA receptor antagonist, a H1-receptor antagonist, a parasympatholytic, a muscle relaxant and a muscarinic antagonist. It contains an orphenadrine. it is the citrate salt form of orphenadrine with a muscle relaxant property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it appears to block cholinergic receptors, thereby interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses from the spinal cord to the muscles. It does not produce myoneural block, nor does it affect crossed extensor reflexes.
