it appears as pale yellow crystals or yellowish powder. Decomposes at 243-244Â°C. Used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A known carcinogen. it is a thiopurine that is 6-mercaptopurine in which the mercapto hydrogen is replaced by a 1-methyl-4-nitroimidazol-5-yl group. It is a prodrug for mercaptopurine and is used as an immunosuppressant, prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and after organ transplantation and also for treatment of Crohn's didease and MS. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an immunosuppressive agent, a prodrug, a carcinogenic agent, a DNA synthesis inhibitor and a hepatotoxic agent. It is a thiopurine, a C-nitro compound, a member of imidazoles and an aryl sulfide. it is a purine analogue with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity. it is a prodrug that is converted by hepatic xanthine oxidase to its active metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). 6-MP is further metabolized by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) into 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thio-GMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (6-thio-IMP), both inhibit nucleotide conversions and de novo purine synthesis. This leads to inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. As a result, cell proliferation may be inhibited, particularly in lymphocytes and leukocytes.
