it is an aminobenzoate that is the conjugate base of 4-aminosalicylic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group. Major miscrospecies at pH 7.3. It is a hydroxybenzoate and an aminobenzoate. It derives from a salicylate. It is a conjugate base of a 4-aminosalicylic acid. it is the sodium salt form of aminosalicylic acid, an analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) with antitubercular activity. Aminosalicylate sodium exerts its bacteriostatic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by competing with PABA for enzymes involved in folate synthesis, thereby suppressing growth and reproduction of M. tuberculosis, eventually leading to cell death.
