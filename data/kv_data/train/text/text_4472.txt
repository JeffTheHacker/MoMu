8-Hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, also known as it or daphnetin-7-methyl ether, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxycoumarins. These are coumarins that contain one or more hydroxyl groups attached to the coumarin skeleton. 8-Hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one can be found in green vegetables. This makes 8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
