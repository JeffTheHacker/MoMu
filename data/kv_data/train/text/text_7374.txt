it, also known as eleutheroside e, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lignan glycosides. These are aromatic polycyclic compounds containing a carbohydrate component glycosidically linked to a lignan moiety. They include 1-aryltetralin lactones. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, liriodendrin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, liriodendrin can be found in tea.
