Isoit belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 2-arylbenzofuran flavonoids. These are phenylpropanoids containing the 2-phenylbenzofuran moiety. Isoit is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, isoit is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, isoit can be found in alcoholic beverages and fruits. This makes isoit a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
