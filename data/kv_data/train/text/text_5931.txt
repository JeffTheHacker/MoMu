it is a carbohydrate-containing antibiotic, an anthracycline antibiotic, an aureolic acid and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA polymerase) inhibitor and a metabolite. it is an antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces plicatus with antineoplastic activity. it, also known as it, binds to the minor groove of DNA at GC-rich sites, resulting in inhibition of RNA synthesis; this agent also inhibits mRNA expression, resulting in a reduction in protein synthesis. In addition, plicamycin may inhibit bone resorption by down regulating transcription of c-src, an oncogene involved in bone metabolism and resorption. (NCI04)
