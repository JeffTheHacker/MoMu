3-Thiocyanato-1-propene, also known as it or 2-propenyl thiocyanate, 9CI, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as allyl sulfur compounds. Allyl sulfur compounds are compounds containing an allylsulfur group, with the general structure H2C(=CH2)CS. Within the cell, 3-thiocyanato-1-propene is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 3-thiocyanato-1-propene can be found in brassicas. This makes 3-thiocyanato-1-propene a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
