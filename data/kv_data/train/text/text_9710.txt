it is under investigation in clinical trial NCT00038038 (Assessment of Head and Neck Tumor Hypoxia Using 18F-Fluoroit). it is a nitroimidazole with radiosensitizing and antineoplastic properties. Exhibiting high electron affinity, it induces the formation of free radicals and depletes radioprotective thiols, thereby sensitizing hypoxic cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. This single-strand breaks in DNA induced by this agent result in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. (NCI04)
