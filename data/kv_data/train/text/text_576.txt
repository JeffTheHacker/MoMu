it is a methanesulfonate salt. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent. It contains an eprosartan. it is the mesylate salt form of eprosartan, a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist with antihypertensive activity. it antagonizes angiotensin II type I receptors in tissues such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. This prevents angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and prevents angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which decreases the excretion of sodium and water and increases the excretion of potassium.
