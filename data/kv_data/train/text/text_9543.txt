2', 3'-Dihydro-phytomenadione, also known as 2', 3'-it or 2', 3'-dihydrovitamin K1, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as vitamin k compounds. These are quinone lipids containing a methylated naphthoquinone ring structure, and vary in the aliphatic side chain attached at the 3-position. 2', 3'-Dihydro-phytomenadione is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 2', 3'-dihydro-phytomenadione is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, 2', 3'-dihydro-phytomenadione can be found in a number of food items such as brazil nut, pacific rockfish, canola, and broccoli. This makes 2', 3'-dihydro-phytomenadione a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
