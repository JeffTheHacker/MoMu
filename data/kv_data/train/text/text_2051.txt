4-O-Digalloyl-3, 5-di-O-galloylquinic acid, also known as 3, 5, 4, 4-tetragqa or 3, 5-g-4-digqa, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as depsides and depsidones. These are polycyclic compounds that is either a polyphenolic compound composed of two or more monocyclic aromatic units linked by an ester bond (depside), or a compound containing the depsidone structure (depsidone). 4-O-Digalloyl-3, 5-di-O-galloylquinic acid is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, 4-O-digalloyl-3, 5-di-O-galloylquinic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP).
