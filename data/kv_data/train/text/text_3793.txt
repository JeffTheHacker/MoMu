it is a member of the class of benzamides resulting from the formal condensation of 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid with the primary amino group of N,N-diethylethane-1,2-diamine. It has a role as an antiemetic, a dopaminergic antagonist, a gastrointestinal drug, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a tertiary amino compound, a substituted aniline, a member of benzamides and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). it is a substituted benzamide and a derivative of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) that is structurally related to procainamide, with gastroprokinetic and antiemetic effects. it exerts its prokinetic effect by antagonizing dopamine mediated relaxation effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. This enhances the response of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle to cholinergic stimulation, thereby leading to an increase of gastric emptying into the intestines. it may also strengthen the lower esophagus sphincter, thereby preventing acid reflux. This agent antagonizes D2 dopamine receptors in chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the medulla, thereby preventing nausea and vomiting.
