(3XI, 6XI)-Cyclo(alanylvalyl) belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof (3XI, 6XI)-Cyclo(alanylvalyl) is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, (3xi, 6xi)-cyclo(alanylvalyl) is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, (3xi, 6xi)-cyclo(alanylvalyl) can be found in cocoa and cocoa products. This makes (3xi, 6xi)-cyclo(alanylvalyl) a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
