it is a member of the class of 2-aminopurines that is 2-aminopurine which is substituted by a chlorine at position 6 and by a (4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)methyl group at position 9. It has a role as a Hsp90 inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of pyridines, a member of 2-aminopurines, an organochlorine compound and an aromatic ether. Hsp90 Inhibitor it is an orally active inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) with potential antineoplastic activity. HSP90, a chaperon protein upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, regulates the folding and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins. HSP90 inhibitor it specifically blocks active HSP90, thereby inhibiting its chaperon function and promoting the degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. As a result, it has the potential to inhibit the growth of a wide range of cancer cells in both solid tumors and blood-based cancers.
