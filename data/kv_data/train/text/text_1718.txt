it is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which each of the amino groups has been substituted by a 3-({2-methyl-5-[(4,6,8-trisulfo-1-naphthyl)carbamoyl]phenyl}carbamoyl)phenyl group. An activator of both the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 and sheep cardiac RyR2 isoform ryanodine receptor channels, it has been used for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis for over 100 years. It has a role as a ryanodine receptor agonist, a GABA-gated chloride channel antagonist, a GABA antagonist, an apoptosis inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor, a purinergic receptor P2 antagonist, an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor, an antinematodal drug and a trypanocidal drug. It is a member of phenylureas, a secondary carboxamide and a naphthalenesulfonic acid. It derives from a naphthalene-1,3,5-trisulfonic acid. it is a polysulphonated naphthylurea with potential antineoplastic activity. it blocks the binding of various growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), to their receptors, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and migration. This agent also inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis; retroviral reverse transcriptase; uncoupling of G-proteins from receptors; topoisomerases; cellular folate transport; and steroidogenesis.
