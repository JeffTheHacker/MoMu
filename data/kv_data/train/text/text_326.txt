it is a nonabsorbed bile acid sequestrant that is used a therapy of hyperlipidemia and for the pruritus of chronic liver disease and biliary obstruction. it has been associated with mild and transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. it is an anion exchange resin with hypolipidemic activity. it resin adsorbs and combines with bile acids in the intestine to form an insoluble complex, which is then excreted in the feces, resulting in an increased oxidation of cholesterol to bile acids, a decrease in low density lipoprotein in the plasma, and a decrease in serum cholesterol levels.
