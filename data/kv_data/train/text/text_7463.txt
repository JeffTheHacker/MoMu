Glaucarubolone 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quassinoids. These are a group of compounds chemically degraded from triterpenes. According to their basic skeleton, quassinoids are categorized into five distinct groups, C-18, C-19, C-20, C-22 and C-25 types. The C-20 quassinoids can be further classified into two types, tetracyclic and the pentacyclic. The tetracyclic variety does not have oxygenation at C-20, while the pentacyclic quassinoids possess additional oxygenation at C-20 that allows for the formation of an additional ring. Glaucarubolone 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, glaucarubolone 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, glaucarubolone 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside can be found in fats and oils. This makes glaucarubolone 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.
