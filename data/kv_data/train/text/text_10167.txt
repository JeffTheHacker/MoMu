it (also known as A-3331) is an analog of fentanyl, a potent opioid. This drug is classified as an opioid analgesic and was developed in the early 1990s. The effects of it are very similar to those of alfentanil, with strong but short lasting analgesia and sedation, and particularly notable itching and respiratory depression.
