it is a pyrrolopyrimidine that is 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine which is substituted by a (1S)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylnitrilo group at position 4 and by a (1S,3S,4S)-3-hydroxy-4-[(sulfamoyloxy)methyl]cyclopentyl group at position 7. It is a potent and selective NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor with an IC50 of 4.7 nM, and currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pyrrolopyrimidine, a secondary amino compound, a member of cyclopentanols, a sulfamidate and a member of indanes. it is a small molecule inhibitor of Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits NAE, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and survival. NAE activates Nedd8 (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8), an ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein that modifies cellular targets in a pathway that is parallel to but distinct from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). Functioning in diverse regulatory activities, proteins conjugated to UBLs like Nedd8 typically are not targeted for proteasomal degradation.
