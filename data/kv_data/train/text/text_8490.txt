Doxepin is a dibenzooxepine that is 6,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepine substituted by a 3-(dimethylamino)propylidene group at position 11. It is used as an antidepressant drug. It has a role as an antidepressant. It is a dibenzooxepine and a tertiary amino compound. it is a psychotropic agent similar to doxepin with potential antianxiety and antidepressant activities. Although its exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, cidoxepin may act similarly to doxepin. it may inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing their activity. This may account for its antianxiety and antidepressant effects.
