it, also known as it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylhydantoins. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing an imiazolidinedione moiety substituted by a phenyl group. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from hydroxyphenytoin through the action of the enzymes cytochrome P450 2C9, cytochrome P450 2C19, and cytochrome P450 3A4. In addition, it and S-adenosylmethionine can be converted into phenytoin methylcatechol and S-adenosylhomocysteine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase. In humans, it is involved in the metabolic disorder called the phenytoin (antiarrhythmic) action pathway.
