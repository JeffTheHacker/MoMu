it, also known as fema 3421 or oxopholone, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenones are compounds containing a cylohexenone moiety, which is a six-membered aliphatic ring that carries a ketone and has one endocyclic double bond. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and an extremely weak acidic (essentially neutral) compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, 4-oxoisophorone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. it is a sweet, leaf, and musty tasting compound that can be found in herbs and spices and tea. This makes 4-oxoisophorone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
