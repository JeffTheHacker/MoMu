it is a fatty amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of oleic acid with the amino group of dopamine. Synthesised in catecholaminergic neurons, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and might be considered as a carrier of dopamine into the brain. It is a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptor agonist. It has a role as a TRPV1 agonist. It is a fatty amide, a secondary carboxamide and a member of catechols. It derives from a dopamine and an oleic acid.
