it, also known as podophyllotoxin or neoit, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as podophyllotoxins. These are tetralin it in which the benzene moiety of the tetralin skeleton is fused to a 1, 3-dioxolane and the cyclohexane is fused to a butyrolactone (pyrrolidin-2-one). it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. it has been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in arrowroot and flaxseed. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
