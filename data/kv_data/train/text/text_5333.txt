it is a quinoline having a chloro group at the 7-position and an aryl amino group at the 4-position. It has a role as an antimalarial, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a drug allergen, a prodrug, an EC 2.1.1.8 (histamine N-methyltransferase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of phenols, an aminoquinoline, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound and an organochlorine compound. It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is an orally active 4-aminoquinoline derivative with antimalarial and anti-inflammatory properties. Similar in structure and activity to chloroquine, it is effective against some chloroquine-resistant strains, particularly Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite. Although the mechanism of plasmodicidal action has not been fully elucidated, like other quinoline derivatives, it likely is able to inhibit heme polymerase activity in the body. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites.
