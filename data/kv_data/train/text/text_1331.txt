it is a quaternary ammonium ion obtained by methylation of the tertiary amino group of (1alpha,2beta,4beta,5alpha,7beta)-7-[(hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0(2,4)]nonane. Used (in the form of the bromide hydrate) for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist and a bronchodilator agent. it Bromide Monohydrate is the monohydrate bromide salt form of it, a quaternary ammonium derivative of atropine and a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist, with bronchodilating activity. Upon inhalation, it binds to and blocks mainly muscarinic M3 receptors located on smooth muscle cells, thereby preventing smooth muscle contraction.
