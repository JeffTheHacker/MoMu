it is a tertiary amino compound that is N-ethyl-N-methylethanamine substituted by a 4-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]phenoxy and a 4-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]phenyl group at the terminal carbon atoms respectively. It is used as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug and a potassium channel blocker. It is a sulfonamide, an aromatic ether and a tertiary amino compound. it is a sulfonamide class III antiarrhythmic agent and potassium channel blocker. it selectively blocks cardiac ion channels of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current Ikr. This antiarrhythmic agent prolongs cardiac action potential duration and effective refractory period due to delayed repolarization without affecting conduction velocity. This results in a normal sinus rhythm. it is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter.
