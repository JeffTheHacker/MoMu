it, also known as 4-ethyl-2, 3, 5-trithiahexane or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkyldisulfides. These are organic compounds containing a disulfide group R-SS-R' where R and R' are both alkyl groups. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. Within the cell, methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl disulfide is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Outside of the human body, methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl disulfide can be found in garden onion and onion-family vegetables. This makes methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl disulfide a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.
