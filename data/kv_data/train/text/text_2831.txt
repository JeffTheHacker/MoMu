it is a cephalosporin having [4-(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl and {(2Z)-2-(ethoxyimino)-2-[5-(phosphonoamino)-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl]acetyl}amino side groups located at positions 3 and 7 respectively. The N-phospho prodrug of ceftaroline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is used for the treatment of adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an antimicrobial agent and a prodrug. It is an iminium betaine, a cephalosporin, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an oxime O-ether, a member of thiadiazoles and an organic phosphoramidate. It derives from a ceftaroline. Ceftaroline Fosamil is an N-phosphono prodrug of the fifth-generation cephalosporin derivative ceftaroline with antibacterial activity. it is hydrolyzed to the active form ceftaroline in vivo. Ceftaroline binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis.
