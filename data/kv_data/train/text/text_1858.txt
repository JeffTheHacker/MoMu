it is a member of the class of thiazolidinones that is 2-sulfanylidene-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one which is substituted at position 5 by a (4-ethylphenyl)methylidene group. It is a cell permeable inhibitor of c-Myc-Max dimerization and exhibits antitumour effects in vivo. It downregulates c-Myc expression and upregulates CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27 resulting in the inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a thiazolidinone and an olefinic compound.
