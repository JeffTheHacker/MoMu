it is a pyridoisoquinoline comprising emetam having methoxy substituents at the 6'-, 7'-, 10- and 11-positions. It is an antiprotozoal agent and emetic. It inhibits SARS-CoV2, Zika and Ebola virus replication and displays antimalarial, antineoplastic and antiamoebic properties. It has a role as an antiprotozoal drug, a plant metabolite, an antiviral agent, an emetic, a protein synthesis inhibitor, an antimalarial, an antineoplastic agent, an autophagy inhibitor, an antiinfective agent, an expectorant and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a pyridoisoquinoline and an isoquinoline alkaloid. It derives from a cephaeline. It is a conjugate base of an it(2+). It derives from a hydride of an emetan. it Hydrochloride is the chloride salt of a white crystalline bitter alkaloid isolated from the root of the plant Psychotria Ipecacuanha (ipecac root) and other plants with antiemetic and anthelminthic properties. it inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic (but not prokaryotic) cells by irreversibly blocking ribosome movement along the mRNA strand and inhibits DNA replication in the early S phase of the cell cycle.
