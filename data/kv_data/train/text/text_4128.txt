Levobunolol Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of levobunolol, a naphthalenone and non-cardioselective adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist with anti-glaucoma activity. Upon administration in the eye, levobunolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby causing vasoconstriction. Levobunolol also decreases ciliary's body production of aqueous humor, leading to a decrease in aqueous humor.
