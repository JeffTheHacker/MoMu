it is the hydrochloride salt of paroxetine. It is an antidepressant drug. It has a role as an antidepressant, an anxiolytic drug, a hepatotoxic agent, a P450 inhibitor and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. It contains a paroxetinium(1+). it is the hydrochloride salt form of paroxetine, a phenylpiperidine derivative and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. Paroxetine binds to the pre-synaptic serotonin transporter complex resulting in negative allosteric modulation of the complex thereby blocking reuptake of serotonin by the pre-synaptic transporter. Inhibition of serotonin recycling enhances serotonergic function through serotonin accumulation in the synaptic cleft, resulting in long-term desensitization and downregulation of 5HT1 (serotonin) receptors and leading to symptomatic relief of depressive illness.
