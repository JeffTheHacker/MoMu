it is an intravenously administered platinum coordination complex and alkylating agent which is used as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers, mainly ovarian, head and neck and lung cancers. it therapy is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations and with rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. it is a second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties. it contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)
