it is the L-enantiomer of it. It has a role as a human metabolite, an algal metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a it family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a L-alpha-amino acid and a it. It is a conjugate base of a L-serinium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-serinate. It is an enantiomer of a D-it. It is a tautomer of a it zwitterion. it is a non-essential amino acid in humans (synthesized by the body), it is present and functionally important in many proteins. With an alcohol group, it is needed for the metabolism of fats, fatty acids, and cell membranes; muscle growth; and a healthy immune system. It also plays a major role in pyrimidine, purine, creatine, and porphyrin biosynthetic pathways. it is also found at the active site of the it protease enzyme class that includes trypsin and chymotrypsin.
