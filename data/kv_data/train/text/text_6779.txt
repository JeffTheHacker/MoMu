it is the sodium salt of methohexital. It has a role as an intravenous anaesthetic. It contains a methohexital(1-). it is the sodium salt of methohexital, a rapid, short-acting barbituric acid derivative, with anesthetic activity. Methohexital binds to the chloride ionophore site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A/chloride ionophore receptor complex, thereby enhancing the inhibitory actions of GABA-A in the brain. This leads to synaptic inhibition, decreased neuronal excitability and induction of anesthesia. In addition, this agent decreases glutamate (Glu) responses.
