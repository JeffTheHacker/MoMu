it is an addition compound. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent and an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It contains a perindopril(1-). it is the tert-butylamine salt of perindopril, the ethyl ester of a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Upon hydrolysis, it is converted to its active form perindoprilat, inhibiting ACE and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; consequently, angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex are inhibited and diuresis and natriuresis ensue.
