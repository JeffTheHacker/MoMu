it is the hydrochloride salt form of dorzolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, protons and bicarbonate ions. Distributed throughout many cells and tissues, various carbonic anhydrases play important roles in mineral and metabolic homeostasis. (NCI04)
