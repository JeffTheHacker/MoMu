it is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is daidzein substituted by a 6-O-(carboxyacetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxyisoflavone, a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a malonate ester and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a daidzein 7-O-beta-D-glucoside.
