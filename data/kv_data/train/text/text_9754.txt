Sedoheptulose, also known as it or volemulose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as heptoses. These are monosaccharides in which the sugar unit is a seven-carbon containing moeity. Sedoheptulose is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, sedoheptulose is primarily located in the cytoplasm.
