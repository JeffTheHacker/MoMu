Arsenic trioxide, also known as arsenious acid or trixenox, belongs to the class of inorganic compounds known as miscellaneous arsenites. These are inorganic compounds in which the largest metallic oxoanion is arsenite, to which either no atom or a non metal atom is bonded. Arsenic trioxide has been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, arsenic trioxide is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Arsenic trioxide is formally rated as a carcinogen (by IARC 1) and is also a potentially toxic compound.
