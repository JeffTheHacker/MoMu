it is the active metabolite of cilazapril, a pyridazine angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. As a prodrug, cilazapril is rapidly metabolized in the liver to it; it competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation. it also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which leads to an increase in sodium excretion and subsequently increases water outflow.
