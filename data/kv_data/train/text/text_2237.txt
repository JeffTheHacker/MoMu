Liquids. Toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin absorption. More dense than water. Flash points usually below 140Â°F. Contact may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. If available, obtain the technical name of the material from the shipping papers and contact CHEMTREC, (800-424-9300) for specific response information. it is a 3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine in which the chiral centre has S-configuration. The naturally occurring and most active enantiomer of it, isolated from Nicotiana tabacum. It has a role as a phytogenic insecticide, a teratogenic agent, a neurotoxin, an anxiolytic drug, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, a biomarker, an immunomodulator, a mitogen, a peripheral nervous system drug, a psychotropic drug, a plant metabolite and a xenobiotic. It is a conjugate base of a (S)-nicotinium(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (R)-it. it is a plant alkaloid, found in the tobacco plant, and addictive central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that causes either ganglionic stimulation in low doses or ganglionic blockage in high doses. it acts as an agonist at the nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the autonomic ganglia, at neuromuscular junctions, and in the adrenal medulla and the brain. it's CNS-stimulating activities may be mediated through the release of several neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, beta-endorphin, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and ACTH. As a result, peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure may be observed with it intake. This agent may also stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone, thereby inducing nausea and vomiting.
