it is a benzodiazepine derivative with antidepressant, sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties. it potentiates the inhibitory activities of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by binding to the GABA receptor, located in the limbic, neocortical and mesencephalic reticular system. This increases the frequency of chloride channel opening events, allowing the flow of chloride ions into the neuron leading to membrane hyperpolarization and decreases neuronal excitability.
