Imidacloprid, also known as confidor or IMD, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitroguanidines. These are organonitrogen compounds containing a nitro group, which is N-linked to a guanidine. Imidacloprid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, imidacloprid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Imidacloprid can be biosynthesized from 2-chloropyridine. Imidacloprid is a potentially toxic compound.
