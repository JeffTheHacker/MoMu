Alpha-D-Glucopyranose Monohydrate is the monohydrate form of the alpha isoform of D-glucopyranose, a synthetic simple monosaccharide that is used as an energy source. D- glucopyranose is oxidized in various tissues under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions through glycolysis; the oxidation reaction produces carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.
