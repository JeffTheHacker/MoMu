Cabergoline is an N-acylurea that is (8R)-ergoline-8-carboxamide in which the hydrogen attached to the piperidine nitrogen (position 6) is substituted by an allyl group and the hydrogens attached to the carboxamide nitrogen are substituted by a 3-(dimethylamino)propyl group and an N-ethylcarbamoyl group. A dopamine D2 receptor agonist, cabergoline is used in the management of Parkinson's disease and of disorders associated with hyperprolactinaemia. It has a role as a dopamine agonist, an antiparkinson drug and an antineoplastic agent.
