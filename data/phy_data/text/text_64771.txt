Spectinomycin Sulfate is the sulfate salt form of spectinomycin, an aminocyclitol aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from Streptomyces spectabilis with bacteriostatic activity. Spectinomycin binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. As a result, this agent interferes with the initiation of protein synthesis and with proper protein elongation. This eventually leads to bacterial cell death.
