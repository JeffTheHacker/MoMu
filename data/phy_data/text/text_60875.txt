Naratriptan Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of naratriptan, a sulfonamide with selective serotonin (5-HT) 1 receptor agonistic activity and anti-migraine property. Naratriptan hydrochloride binds selectively and with high affinity to the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. Activation of these 5-HT1D/B receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction and provides relief of migraine headaches. Naratriptan hydrochloride may also exerts its effect by stimulation of 5-HT1D/1B receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system thereby decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides.
