Remifentanil Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of remifentanil, a synthetic anilidopiperidine derivative and short-acting opiate agonist with analgesic and anesthetic properties. Remifentanil selectively binds to and activates the mu-opioid receptor, thereby producing analgesia, respiratory depression, miosis, reduced gastrointestinal motility, and euphoria.
