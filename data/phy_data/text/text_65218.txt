A fluorescent probe with low toxicity which is a potent substrate for ATP BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 1 and the bacterial multidrug efflux transporter. It is used to assess mitochondrial bioenergetics in living cells and to measure the efflux activity of ATP BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 1 in both normal and malignant cells.
