1H-tetrazole is an odorless white to light-yellow crystalline powder. Mp:1 55-157Â°C. When heated to decomposition it emits toxic oxides of nitrogen fumes. Can explode if exposed to shock or heat from friction or fire. The primary hazard is from blast effect where the entire load can explode instantaneously and not from flying projectiles and fragments.
