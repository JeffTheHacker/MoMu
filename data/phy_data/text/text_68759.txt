Glutaurine is a dipeptide resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of taurine with the gamma-carboxy group of L-glutamic acid. It was initially found in the parathyroid in 1980 and later in the brain of mammals. It has a role as a mouse metabolite, a mammalian metabolite, a human metabolite, an anticonvulsant, an anxiolytic drug and a hormone. It is a L-glutamine derivative, a sulfonic acid and a dipeptide. It derives from a taurine. It is a tautomer of a glutaurine zwitterion.
