Triasulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is N-[o-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]sulfonylurea in which one of the hydrogens attached to the non-sulfonylated nitrogen has been replaced by a 4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. A herbicide used to control broad-leaved weeds in cereals, its use within the EU has been banned after September 2017 on the grounds of potential groundwater contamination and risks to aquatic life. It has a role as a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is an aromatic ether, a N-sulfonylurea, a member of 1,3,5-triazines and an organochlorine compound.
