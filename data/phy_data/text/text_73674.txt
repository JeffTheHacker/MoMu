It is used as a post-emergence herbicide for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of thiophenes, a member of 1,3,5-triazines and a methyl ester. It derives from a thifensulfuron.
