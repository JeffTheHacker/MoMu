Maslinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 and a carboxy group at position 28 (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). It is isolated from Olea europaea and Salvia canariensis and exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
