Tallimustine, a benzoyl mustard derivative of distamycin A, is an alkylating agent that binds to the minor groove of DNA. It's association with severe myelotoxicity lead to the end of its development in favour of Î±-halogenoacrylamide derivatives such as [brostallicin], which have a favourable cytotoxicity/myelotoxicity ratio. Newer generations of DNA minor groove binding agents can more specifically recognize base pair sequences.
