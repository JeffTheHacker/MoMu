(S)-fenfluramine is the S-enantiomer of fenfluramine. It stimulates the release of serotonin and selectively inhibits its reuptake, but unlike fenfluramine it does not possess catecholamine agonist activity. It was formerly given by mouth as the hydrochloride in the treatment of obesity, but, like fenfluramine, was withdrawn wolrdwide following reports of valvular heart defects. It has a role as an appetite depressant, a serotonergic agonist and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-fenfluramine.
