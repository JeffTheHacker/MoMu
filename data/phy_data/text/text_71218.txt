Anaxirone is a synthetic triepoxide alkylating agent with potential antineoplastic activity. Anaxirone alkylates DNA via actual or derived epoxide groups, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis. This agent has been shown to exhibit a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity against experimental tumors, including those resistant to other alkylating agents.
