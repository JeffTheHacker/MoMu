6-O-methylguanine is a methylguanine in which the methyl group is positioned on the oxygen at position 6. Formed in DNA by alkylation of the oxygen atom of guanine, most often by N-nitroso compounds and sometimes due to methylation by other compounds such as endogenous S-adenosylmethionine, it base-pairs to thymine rather than cytidine, causing a G:C to A:T transition in DNA. It has a role as a mutagen.
