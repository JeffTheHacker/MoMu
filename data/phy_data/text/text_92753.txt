Propionyl-CoA is an acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of propionic acid. It has a role as a metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a coenzyme A and a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a propionyl-CoA(4-).
