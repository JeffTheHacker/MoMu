Galocitabine is an orally available 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrug with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, galocitabine is converted into 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine, 5'-deoxy-fluorouridine, and 5-FU. 5-FU is further metabolized into other cytotoxic metabolites that interfere with RNA and DNA synthesis via inhibition of thymidylate synthase. As a result, this agent eventually inhibits tumor cell growth.
