Retelliptine is an ellipticine derivative and topoisomerase II inhibitor with antineoplastic activity. Retelliptine intercalates with DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II during DNA replication. In addition, this agent appears to induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis mediated through the Fas/Fas ligand death receptor and the mitochondrial pathway.
