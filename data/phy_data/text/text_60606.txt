Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine that is 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by an o-chlorobenzyl group, the methylene hydrogen of which is replaced by a methoxycarbonyl group (the S enantiomer). A P2Y12 receptor antagonist, it is used to inhibit blood clots and prevent heart attacks. It has a role as a platelet aggregation inhibitor, an anticoagulant and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. It is a thienopyridine, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a methyl ester. It derives from a ticlopidine.
