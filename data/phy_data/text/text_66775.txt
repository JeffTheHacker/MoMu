Methylcyclopentadiene appears as a pale yellow liquid or crystalline solid. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors are heavier than air. Vapor can injure the eyes and respiratory tract and may cause headaches and dizziness. Vapor is anesthetic and may have other central nervous system effects. Vapor may also cause liver and kidney disorder. Ingestion of the liquid into the respiratory system, or from vomiting, may cause bronchopneumonia or pulmonary edema.
