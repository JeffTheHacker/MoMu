Cercosporin is an organic heterohexacyclic compound that is perylo[1,12-def][1,3]dioxepine-6,11-dione substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 12, by methoxy groups at positions 7 and 10, and by 2-hydroxypropyl groups at positions 8 and 9 (the R,R-stereoisomer). It is a phytotoxin which was first isolated from the pathogenic soybean fungus, Cercospora kikuchii and later found in multiple members of the genus Cercospora. It has a role as a photosensitizing agent, a phytotoxin, a fungal metabolite and a reactive oxygen species generator. It is a polyphenol, a polyketide and an organic heterohexacyclic compound. It is a conjugate acid of a cercosporin(2-).
