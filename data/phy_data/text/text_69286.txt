Triheptanoin is a source of heptanoate fatty acids, which can be metabolized without the enzymes of long chain fatty acid oxidation. In clinical trials, patients with long chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (lc-FAODs) treated with triheptanoin are less likely to develop hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatomegaly. Complications in lc-FAOD patients are reduced from approximately 60% to approximately 10% with the addition of triheptanoin.  Triheptanoin was granted FDA approval on 30 June 2020.
