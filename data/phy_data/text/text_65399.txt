Triciribine is a nucleoside analogue in which the nucleobase portion is a 1,4,5,6,8-pentaazaacenaphthylene ring system substituted with an amino group at position 3, and a methyl group at position 5 and is bound to the beta-D-ribofuranosyl moiety by an N(1)-glycosidic linkage. It has a role as an EC 2.7.1.137 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitor.
