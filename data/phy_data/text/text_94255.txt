A natural product found in several species in the Apocynaceae (dogbane) family, including Alstonia spatulata. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an antiplasmodial drug. It is an Aspidosperma alkaloid, a methyl ester, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an organonitrogen heterocyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a (-)-vincadifformine(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (+)-vincadifformine.
