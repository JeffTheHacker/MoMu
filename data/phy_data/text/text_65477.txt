Chlorphentermine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of chlorphentermine, a chlorinated analogue of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine with central nervous system (CNS) stimulating and anorexic activity. Chlorphentermine acts by facilitating the release of catecholamines, especially noradrenaline and dopamine, from nerve terminals in the brain and also inhibits their uptake. The increase in synaptic concentrations of these catecholamines causes behavioral changes including an increase in motor activity, mental alertness and excitement, causes euphoria, and suppresses appetite.
