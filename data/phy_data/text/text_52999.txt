Metsulfuron methyl is a N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfonyl group is attached to a 2-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl group while a (4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group replaces one of the amino hydrogens of the remaining urea group. It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of 1,3,5-triazines, a benzoate ester and a N-sulfonylurea.
