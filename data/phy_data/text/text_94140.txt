Stearoyl-CoA is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of stearic acid. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an octadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a stearoyl-CoA(4-).
