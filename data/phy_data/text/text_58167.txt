Toxaphene is a synthetic mixture of chlorinated camphenes with a yellow waxy appearance that is practically insoluble in water and soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons. Toxaphene had been used as a pesticide in the US before and all uses were banned in 1990. When heated to decomposition, toxaphene emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds. Exposure of humans to toxaphene causes stimulation of the central nervous system, which results in convulsive seizures. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
