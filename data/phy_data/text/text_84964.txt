Di-(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl)peroxydicarbonate, [technically pure] is a crystalline solid. This solid peroxide is particularly heat and contamination sensitive. These materials above a given "control temperature" may decompose violently. They are often stored in a temperature controlled vessel, also mixed with water to form a slurry of the peroxide. This greatly lessens the explosion hazard risk.
