Biocytin is a monocarboxylic acid amide that results from the formal condensation of the carboxylic acid group of biotin with the N(6)-amino group of L-lysine. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is an azabicycloalkane, a thiabicycloalkane, a member of ureas, a monocarboxylic acid amide, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a L-lysine derivative. It derives from a biotin.
