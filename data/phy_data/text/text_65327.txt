Desipramine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). In the central nervous system (CNS), desipramine hydrochloride blocks the re-uptake of neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and serotonin. This leads to an increase in the amount of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft and prolongs their activities postsynaptically.
