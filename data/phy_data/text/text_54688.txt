Clarithromycin is an antibiotic prescription medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat certain bacterial infections—including community-acquired pneumonia, throat infections (pharyngitis), acute sinus infections, and others—that are caused by specific types of bacteria. Clarithromycin is also FDA-approved to both prevent and treat Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, another type of bacterial infection.
