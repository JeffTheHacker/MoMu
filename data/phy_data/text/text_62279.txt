Ohmefentanyl is an extremely potent opioid analgesic drug which selectively binds to the µ-opioid receptor. The Chinese have recorded ohmefentanyl as having a potency that is 6,300 times morphine. Ohmefentanyl is one of the most potent μ -receptor agonists known, comparable to super-potent opioids such as carfentanil and etorphine which are used for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants in veterinary medicine. In mice, ohmefentanyl was 28 times more powerful than fentanyl and 6300 times more effective than morphine. Ohmefentanyl has three stereogenic centers and hence, it can derive into eight stereoisomers, currently named F9201–F9208. Researchers are studying the different pharmaceutical properties of these isomers.
