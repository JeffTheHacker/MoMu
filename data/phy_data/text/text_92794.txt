Naringenin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside is a flavanone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside that is (S)-naringenin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a metabolite, a hypoglycemic agent, an antilipemic drug and an antibacterial agent. It is a flavanone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside, a dihydroxyflavanone, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones and a (2S)-flavan-4-one. It derives from a (S)-naringenin.
