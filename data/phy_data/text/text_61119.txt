Alphameprodine is an opioid analgesic classified by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration under Schedule I of illegal substances. The stereoisomer betameprodine is similarly classified, however alphameprodine is more widely used (both are referred to as Meprodine). Alphameprodine is a structural analogue of meperidine. It exerts physiological effects characteristic of opioids, such as analgesia, euphoria and sedation, as well as itching, nausea, and respiratory depression.
