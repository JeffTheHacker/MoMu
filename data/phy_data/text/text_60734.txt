Celgosivir is a 6-0-butanoyl ester derivative of castanospermine, a compound derived from the Australian chestnut with activity against hepatitis C virus. Celgosivir rapidly converts to castanospermine in the body, where it is a potent inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase I, a host enzyme required for viral assembly, release, and infectivity.
