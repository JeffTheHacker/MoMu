Kalopanaxsaponin A is a triterpenoid saponin that is hederagenin attached to a 2-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the stem bark of Kalopanax pictus. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin, a disaccharide derivative and a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hederagenin.
