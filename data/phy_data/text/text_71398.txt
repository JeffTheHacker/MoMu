Masoprocol is the meso-form of nordihydroguaiaretic acid. An antioxidant found in the creosote bush, Larrea divaricata, it is a potent lipoxygenase inhibitor that interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism. It also inhibits (though to a lesser extent) formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, carboxylesterase, and cyclooxygenase. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, a hypoglycemic agent and a metabolite.
