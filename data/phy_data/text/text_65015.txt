Plerixafor is an azamacrocycle consisting of two cyclam rings connected by a 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene) linker. It is a CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist and a hematopoietic stem cell mobilizer. It is used in combination with grulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the perpheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. It has a role as an immunological adjuvant, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-HIV agent and a C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 antagonist. It is an azamacrocycle, a crown amine, a secondary amino compound, an azacycloalkane, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It derives from a 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane.
