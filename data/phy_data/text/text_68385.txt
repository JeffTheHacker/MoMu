Trimethobenzamide Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of trimethobenzamide, a benzamide derivative with an antiemetic property. Although the mechanism of action is largely unknown, it inhibits the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impulses are conveyed to the vomiting center, thereby suppressing nausea and vomiting.
