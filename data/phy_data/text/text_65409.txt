5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate is an aryl phosphate that is indoxyl phopshate in which the indole moiety is substituted at positions 4 and 5 by chlorine and bromine, respectively. It is used to test for the presence of an enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, which cleaves the phosphate group to give 5-bromo-4-chloroindoxyl, which immediately dimerises to give an intensely blue product. It has a role as a chromogenic compound. It is an organochlorine compound, an organobromine compound, a member of indoles and an aryl phosphate. It derives from an indoxyl.
