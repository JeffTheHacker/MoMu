Tolnidamine is an indazole carboxylic acid derivative with antispermatogenic and potential antineoplastic activity. As a male contraceptive, tolnidamine may irreversibly inhibit sperm production. This agent is less nephrotoxic than ionidamide, but it is just as effective in antispermatogenic action to ionidamide.
