Terreic acid is a 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone that is 5,6-epoxy. It is a natural product of Aspergillus terreus. It has an antibacterial activity explained by its inhibitory effect on bacterial enzymes MurA and GlmU. It is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and has an anti-tumoral activity against HeLa and EAC cells. It has a role as a mycotoxin, an antibacterial agent, an EC 2.5.1.7 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) inhibitor, an EC 2.3.1.* (acyltransferase transferring other than amino-acyl group) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.10.2 (non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor, an Aspergillus metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an arene epoxide, a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone, a member of monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones and a diketone. It derives from a 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone.
