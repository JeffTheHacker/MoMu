Brequinar is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid that is quinoline substituted by 2'-fluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl, methyl, carboxy and fluoro groups at positions 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. It is an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The compound exhibits antineoplastic and antiviral properties. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.2 [dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor, an immunosuppressive agent, an antineoplastic agent, an antiviral agent, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, an anticoronaviral agent and an antimetabolite. It is a member of biphenyls, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid and a monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a brequinar(1-).
