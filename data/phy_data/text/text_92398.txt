Morpholinodoxorubicin is a semisynthetic derivative of the anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic doxorubicin.  As an antineoplastic agent, morpholinodoxorubicin is more potent than doxorubicin.  Similar to doxorubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin intercalates into DNA and causes single- and double-strand breaks in DNA via inhibition of topoisomerase I and II.  Unlike doxorubicin, this agent is metabolized in vivo to a DNA-alkylating derivative that forms DNA interstrand cross-links, thereby potentiating its doxorubicin-like cytotoxicity. (NCI04)
