Copovithane is a synthetic polymer (copolymer of 1,3-bis(methylaminocarboxyl)-2-methylenepropanecarbamate and N-vinyl pyrrolidone) of low molecular weight which acts as a nonspecific immune modulator and has been shown to have significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo in preclinical and some early clinical studies. The mechanism of action is unknown. Immunologic evaluation revealed some improvement in helper and suppressor T cell ratio, in vitro cytotoxicity tests, and lymphocyte blastogenic response. (NCI)
