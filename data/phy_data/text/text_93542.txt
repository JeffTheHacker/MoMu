Fluthiacet-methyl is a methyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of fluthiacet with methanol. A proherbicide for fluthiacet, it is used for the control of broad-leaved weeds in crops such as maize and soya. It has a role as an agrochemical, an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor and a proherbicide. It is an organic sulfide, a methyl ester, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a thiadiazolopyridazine. It derives from a fluthiacet.
