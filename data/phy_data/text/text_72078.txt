It is a prodrug for prednisolone that is activated in vivo by phosphatases. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, a prodrug and an antineoplastic agent. It is a steroid phosphate, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a glucocorticoid.
