Levobetaxolol Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of levobetaxolol, the S-isomer of the -selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist betaxolol with anti-glaucoma activity and devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. When applied topically in the eye, levobetaxolol reduces aqueous humor secretion and lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP).
