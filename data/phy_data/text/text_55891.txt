Fosinopril is a phosphinate ester-containing N-acyl derivative of (4S)-cyclohexyl-L-proline. It is used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. A pro-drug, it is hydrolysed in vivo to the corresponding phosphininc acid, fosinoprilat, which is the active metabolite. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor, a prodrug and an antihypertensive agent. It is a phosphinic ester and a L-proline derivative. It derives from a fosinoprilat. It is a conjugate acid of a fosinopril(1-).
