Octimibate is an acyl-Coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor with antilipidemic, antiatherosclerotic, and antithrombotic activity. In an animal model, inhibition of ACAT by octimibate increased HDL receptor activity and stimulated HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophages.
