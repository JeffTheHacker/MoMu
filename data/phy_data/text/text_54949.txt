Trimetrexate Glucuronate is a lipid soluble methotrexate derivative with potential antineoplastic activity.  Trimetrexate glucuronate inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, thereby preventing the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate, with subsequent inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis.  Trimetrexate glucuronate also exhibits antiviral activity. (NCI04)
