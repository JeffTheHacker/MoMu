Triflusulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is urea in which a hydrogen attached to one of the nitrogens has been replaced by a (2-carboxy-6-methylphenyl)sulfonyl group, while a hydrogen attached to the other nitrogen has been replaced by a 4-(dimethylamino)-6-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used (generally as the corresponding methyl ester proherbicide) to control annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds in sugar beet and other crops. It has a role as an agrochemical, a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a member of benzoic acids, a N-sulfonylurea, a member of 1,3,5-triazines, a tertiary amino compound, an aromatic ether and an organofluorine compound.
