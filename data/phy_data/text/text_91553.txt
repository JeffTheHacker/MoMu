4-methylumbelliferone beta-D-glucuronide is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid having a 4-methylumbelliferyl substituent at the anomeric position. A hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor, it is anti-tumourigenic for various malignant tumours. It has a role as a chromogenic compound, an antineoplastic agent and a hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor. It is a member of coumarins, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a 4-methylumbelliferone. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-methylumbelliferone beta-D-glucuronide(1-).
